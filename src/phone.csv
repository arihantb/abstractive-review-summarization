"i received defective iphone 7 32GB silver colour during ""Great Indian Festival Sale 2018"".Amazon delivered the product in a Day.But Product seems to be non functional. as Rear camera get Freeze due to faulty camera sensor. Just to save the time & money, i bought it from Amazon online E-store. Now Amazon representative, asked me to visit Apple Service store. So far i have wasted my precious time & my mind . The phone was sold by ""Sold by Appario Retail Private Ltd "" .I'm really fed up till now. expecting Amazon to do quick action against it.",iPhone 7
"Redmi phones cameras are great, of course iPhone is better but is the 6 more Redmi phones that I can get for 1 iPhone justifiable for such a difference in price? Well, absolutely yes.iPhone camera is not just better, it is so much better than comparing them are like comparing a Alto with BMW, yes both have 4 wheels, both have AC, both can run at 100 kmph, but you know the difference.The high price of iPhone is so justified by the sheer brilliance of camera it has. Sure it is just 12 MP, but the clarity, my o my!Sure the battery is just about 2600 compared to 3500 of a Redmi, but it lasts longer than a Redmi.I know I am comparing a low budget phone to a premium one, but there are so many people (I was one of them) who were not able to see the reason behind the steep price of iPhone.I have been using a MacBook for 10 years and since my work depends on it, I need it, but a phone? Why? It is not a necessity like the laptop, it is just for calling and taking pics occasionally, and I have my SLR for photography.But I was so wrong, an iPhone is an iPhone. Once you use it, there is no turning back.My last iPhone was a 4S and then since I love buying phones every 6 months, I shifted to Android (Redmi, Samsung, Honor) to satiate my hunger for new phones. All these phones are superb, no doubt, but once you use the iPhone 7, you know that the difference between these phones and iPhone 6s has got much bigger because of the camera.And features like Airdrop (100 pics transferred from the phone to Macbook within 4-5 seconds) are so good if you are using both iPhone and Macbook.Bottom line, iPhone 7 has jumped a big leap from the 6s and the 8 is almost similar. The X is double the price of a 7, so probably all things taken in account, the iPhone 7 is the best value for money among all phones in India",iPhone 7
Thanks for Amazon service. phone is very nice and cool also is the display was very very cool the sound clarity is excellent and phone is very slim. And the processor is very fast Nice performance in gaming. Compare to other phones this is superb.,iPhone 7
If you are an apple fan !! This is a true beauty to go for !!,iPhone 7
"First of all one would want to know is the product genuine and not refurbished coz during Amazon Big Sale I got it for 35k.Before unboxing the I checked up at Apple website and Online check with serial no , EMEI no and other detailsAnd it was 100% genuine and new Handset.Phone is working greatDelivery was also quick in 03 days ..",iPhone 7
in 20 days i found my battery health 98% which was very disappointing experience.  i suggest all the users for not to buy any apple device which is very worst battery setup.,iPhone 7
"Very good specs which can handle updates for next 4 yrs .Good phone for people who don't use power hungry apps for long durations ,camera definitely upto the mark",iPhone 7
"Totally disappointed within a month paint started to coming off, iphone started heating. I didn’t aspect this from apple. Seller gave really bad product. How can I exchange my product.I couldn’t believe that paint is starting to came off so early. I purchased this devise on 6 jan 2020 and today is 23 jan 2020 barely a month passed.I want my refund from this seller.",iPhone 7
Everything is awesome when it comes to an iphone. You will surely love it after few days uses.Thanks for Amazon service. phone is very nice and cool. Fingerprint work fast and fine.also is the display was very cool the sound clarity is excellent and phone is very slim. And the processor is very fast Nice performance in gaming. Compare to other android  phones this is superb.Cons:- however now it lags behind its successors in not having FaceID.Go for iphone X or higher.,iPhone 7
This iPhone7 is in hearing problems. What Can I do,iPhone 7
"Exactly after one year 1 week the ear piece ddnt work. when i went to the store they asked me 35k for replacement. useless phones. for the premium price tag of 55-60K the phones dont even work for 1 year. I had 5s, 6 Plus and this 7. All had same type of problems and the phone went into trouble exactly after warranty.Useless.These big companies take india and indians for a ride.I would never buy any apple products for sure.",iPhone 7
"Battery life of my device is minimal. Drains so fast. In 4 days of usage, battery health reduced to 98%. I am using iPhone for last 4-5 years. But this product delivered was astonishing. Value for money not provided by Amazon for iPhone 7.",iPhone 7
"Coming from oneplus 3, this phone has been a great upgrade. Always wanted to know why the iOS is so popular. Well it is because it never disappoints. I am writing this review one year after purchasing it and it works like a charm. Still. I don’t feel the need to upgrade to some other device (iphone 8, x or xs) because it works flawlessly without any lag or delay whatsoever. The camera is great.The only problem is the battery life which isn’t enough for a complete day.",iPhone 7
Over all phone is very good except it’s  battery. If you are a full time internet user don’t buy this phone. Battery life maximum 8 hours if you using full time internet.,iPhone 7
battery life is bad... also now ios system files take up 15 gb so approx 15gb left for files storage... becomes very less... apple should give users 32 gb useable space as they are charging us for it.,iPhone 7
"Poor product, I want to replace this product , Battery back up is not at all good, decreasing every 2-3min, I recently had iphone 6s and it wasn't the same. On stand by it decresed 20% last night",iPhone 7
I have been using it since the last 2 days and have noticed some heating issues .. We have 2 other iPhone 7’s but none of them heat up like this one .. Usually heats up when I’m on an application or charging . Will definitely return the product .Really disappointed,iPhone 7

"This is my first ever iPhone. To be honest, it was really tougher for me initially to understand things on an iPhone when you're used with Android phones for several years. The first problem I faced is when I want all my contacts from Android phones to to my iPhone. Fortunately some app in the app store helped me copying the contacts from my Google account to iPhone. However I was not able to get the WhatsApp backup from Android to iPhone. Reading some tutorials made me understand that it is better to lose the chats to spend hours on the procedure.No launcher like Android (Probably iPhone users are used with it).• The fingerprint sensor is not as fast and responsive as my Google Pixel 2 XL.• The camera clarity is good. I would not say it is better or best, just good.• Water resistant phone is a relief point.• Call clarity and earphones clarity are good.• Only earphones with lightning interface can be connected, forget your traditional 3.5mm earphones. No adapters are given with the phone, may be you can get one from the market, I believe.• Battery back, charging time are good.• A big relief point is many Google apps such as Google Photos, Google Play Music are available for iPhone, therefore no pain of synchronizing music and photos.Apple fans may argue the price is because it's Apple's phone, okay, but many Android phones with higher specifications are available for this or even lesser price range. If you come from Android platform to iPhone, this might be little disappointing, gives you pain and make you feel cluttered.",iPhone 7

"Fingerprints working is good ,battery backup is bad and camera quality good.....",iPhone 7
I ordered the 32 GB iPhone 7 via Amazon. The phone arrived on time and well packed. The phone was absolutely new and the manufacturing date was as recent asOctober 2018 itself.  The phone is definitely an excellent upgrade over the iPhone 6 and 6s. It comes pre loaded with iOS 12.0.1 and is extremely fast and zippy. The built of the phone is superb and it feels extremely premium. The camera is amazing and the sound quality is loud with a clear output. Overall an excellent phone.,iPhone 7
"Being an Apple customer enjoying IPOD & MAC...This time i took a decision to buy my 1st Apple Phone..But i am totally disappointed with a Poor battery Performance!!!Eventhough it is  not competing with my three years old samsung phone.After 1st week Audio volume for phone calls are pretty low which was not at all audible unless in speakerphone or ear phone.Feeling lot of heat while in calls. Battery draining like rocket. In Hotspot sharing the battery level is draining too fast. I have tried factory reset, software update, Background apps pause, power save mode, mobile data off...but there is no improvement in the battery performance.Finally on the 10th day decided to return back the product to amazon. Unfortunately  options are not allowed/ and the radio buttons not allowed me to place the request.tried to reach customer care but failed to reach them.As a lost resort tired to reach apple customer care. Indian(Bangalore Numbers there is no response).Another time call connected to Australian  call center (Per minute Rs.30 charge.)before reaching executive the call was disconnected with huge BIll.Finally I placed a call back request to apple customer care.an executive called from Singapore Center and convinced me with a message ""in this COVID 19 days we may not support you at service centers@Chennai"".. He guided me to send some analytics (reports) forward to him and to my surprise he confirmed there is no issue in the phone.!!!!!!He sent few basic FAQs on Iphone 7 Battery optimization which is not all all useful for my issue.Now the sad part is i am carrying my phone with charger mostly 4 to 5 charges per day for very minimal calls/Whatsup usage.The worst part is... even though in standby mode also the battery was draining fast.Finally i need to check in Airplane Mode before pack into my box.I strongly believe Iphone 7 had some bugs with battery management.",iPhone 7
"I like how durable this phone is, when I dropped for the first time it was too tall drop and a minor dent was only damage done to my phone.Coming to battery life it will easily fulfil your day.The camera on this phone still better than OnePlus 6T and other smartphoneIm writing this review after a year and half and saw this price I only suggest you just go for it feel the QUALITY!!!",iPhone 7
"Got this product on time, but the harrasment start after that. Product is overheating, calling sound is too bad even unable to hear any words while on call. camera sucks. seems old prosuct in a new packaging.Tried to call amazon support they just pathetic, they forced me to contact with Apple support but Apple support is also sucks. They just avoiding the issue and do not give me support.",iPhone 7
I’m giving one star due to its poor performance in data connectivity. The internet connectivity is very bad. My iPhone 5s was far far better as compared to iPhone 7 performance in terms of connectivity. It has been 36 days since I bought this phone and I already feeling like throwing this phone n go for some android phone. I had a good conversation with the apple support n he also could not figure out the issue n asked me to go to a apple store n get it checked.,iPhone 7

   Packet was totally damaged & ph is in dead condition, also there is no seal on the box , attached video for your reference",iPhone 7
Battery issue. Lasts only 8 hrs. Apple and Amazon website declares 13 hrs of LTE usage. But Apple service centre rejected it and said 8 hrs is the normal life of an iPhone. You have to charge 3 times in a day.Irritating.Amazon have no return policy for the device complaint. You have to approach Apple care only.,iPhone 7
Obviously this product from descendants of Mr Steve Jobs is pure value for money. I would always recommend to go for this unless you are planning to go for an Android device. And yess !! Be ready to spend some more on other connectivity accessories and its truly said “With great power comes great responsibility”,iPhone 7

   I placed order on 21st November, 2020 from Appario Retail Pvt Ltd. Received it today(24th Nov). The box was in good condition, with no signs of damage. The month of manufacture was November 2019 and the product is genuine (confirmed serial number). But it wasn't powering on. On connecting charger, Apple logo comes on screen and again goes off. I contacted Amazon support via chat. I was told that as per Apple policy, I have to contact Apple support. Apple advisor asked me to try charging for a few hours. As it didn't work, I took it to Apple authorized service center. They suspected defective hardware and sent the device for inspection._______________________________________________________________________________________Update: The device I got was defective and I got it replaced by Apple Service Provider",iPhone 7
"From the time I bought the iPhone 7, it shut off, then went dead. Dud a soft restart & a hard reset. Still does not work. Amazon will not accept it back. DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON. They cheat you.",iPhone 7
"Writing this review after 2 + years of purchase. Typing from the same phone..hehe...It's an amazing phone. Which was delivered tome by Amazon really quick and well packed.The phone has not given me any problems.I was an android users and couldn't keep a phone for more than 6-8 months without it showing signs of failure. They used to hang... Become slow...heat up....etc....But this beauty is as solid as a rock...I have dropped it.... Got stamped by shoes...on the road..(had a tempered glass protector which was shattered) but nothing happened to the phone....Lovely battery capacity.Overall, even today, with all the other iPhones releasing one after the other....this is a phone worth buying if you have budget restraints...Don't hesitate.",iPhone 7
"iPhone 7 is excellentUsing iPhones since 2014 so no difficulty in handling the device.Fingerprint is fast and it improves as when the updates are released.Camera quality is very good compared to old devices in my caseBattery life depends on the usage, no of apps downloaded, how many times u do full charge etc.I will recommend to go for iPhone as u get timely updates which is a must for the better working of the device.There are some cons but if u are not concerned about it then go for it without thinking twice.Apple gives premium devices and Amazon gives best services. So I am satisfied with my purchase.",iPhone 7
Packing I received was only the mobile case with no other protection to the box. It was seen that while handling box had got some punctures on the corner due to no bubble bag or any other box. 5- Star for the phone and 1- Star for the amazon service,iPhone 7
"This is a good phone, great experience but I received a defective piece. Apple service center didn't help either.",iPhone 7
The phone I ordered didn’t power up at all.. very bad quality and really pathetic service from Amazon... they would not issue me a replacement and now have to go to apple stores (in this COVID situation - no option of doing virtually) to get Amazon a “service denial letter” before they give any sort of support to me.. please consider carefully before you purchase iPhones from Amazon.. they actually asked me to read up the policy (fine print) and that they cannot help me at all of the piece is defective.. better to go to a local retailer for such any high end purchase,iPhone 7
"The moment I received the product I matched the IMEI and serial code on Apple’s website and it was genuine. I updated it to iOS 14.1 and I faced some battery issues for couple days as battery was draining really fast but it normalised with time.Performance is very smooth and I have faced no problems, switching between apps is smooth as cream, screen is beautiful and 7 works really fine in 2020 too.My use is pretty casual, no gaming, only few social media sites and blog reading, news reading, and it gives me 7-9 hours backup on one full charge easy. It may differ if you are a heavy user, some have reported as less as 3 hour backup, so consider this if you are a gamer or heavy user. In the screenshot, you can see that I had charged iPhone to 99% at 9:45 am, and I was almost on screen surfing through YouTube and it gave me almost 5 and a half hour of backup until battery level dropped at 19%.Satisfied purchase, thank you Amazon.",iPhone 7
"I've been an iphone user since a while and my iphone 5s needed to be upgraded and I was waiting for a good deal. Though I would have liked a better discount I decided to make the best use of Amazon's Prime Sale!The phone has been with about 2 days and its quite early to be able to really comment, however I have faith in Apple. The phone gets quite warm on prolonged use and if this continues I might have to ask for a replacement. Are you there Amazon?",iPhone 7
"Received Phone is dead. Asked for return. They are asking me to reach out to Apple care. Still no luck. After multiple attempts, product got replaced. Now it’s working fine. Thanks to amazon.",iPhone 7
"I got faulty phone . It’s not working . While Iam trying to apply for replacement , It’s asking me to call up call center . I called up & waiting in queue to talk for last 45 min .Is it apple service ? Why can’t you have India consumer care .@ Amazon , This cat be acceptable . Product need to be replaced .",iPhone 7

"I was a fan of apple before my iphone 7, this one and the one I bought few months before this hanged and died. There is a standard reply to pay price of a new phone and get it changed.Problems include power issues, charging issues, restarting, battery die, etc. I would rater buy anything but never apple",iPhone 7
"I will jot down some features for this phone:Pros:1. Very sturdy military grade aluminium body.2. Good battery backup.3. Water resistant.4. Awesome performance, no lags at all.5. What more could one ask for.Cons:1. 3.5 mm audio jack cannot be used and the headphones come with lightning connectors. So you cannot charge and listen to music at the same time. This is actually not a con but some may feel so, trust me as I have been using it for quite some time now, I do not have any grudges.2. That's all folks.Verdict:Best budget iphone that is water resistant and very sturdy.",iPhone 7
"Facing issue with calling and receiving the call, really disappointed from apple. Should not buy from Amazon. I think product is faulty. Worst experience till now.",iPhone 7
Just after 20 days problem starts. Issue with wifi connectivity & internet speed. Till now from last 15days struggling with Apple with all possible diagnostic no result. Seller Pls replace the product. Amazon pls get it replace.,iPhone 7
I bought the product during the great Indian festival sale in October. I really doubt the product is original. Not even been a year the battery life is non existent and camera just refuses to open sometimes. Please do not fall into the trap and invest so much with this seller to just save a few thousand bucks.,iPhone 7
"Received product on 31st January 2020. Battery problem, battery draining very fastly... since last 2 weeks it’s with apple authorised service centre @cochin... Everyday they are saying it will clear with 2-3 days... really disappointed",iPhone 7
"1. I received a model that was manufactured in Nov 2019 (1-year old) and was completely discharged, which means that this product was lying unused for more than a year2. The phone has issues with touch and is not responsive a lot of times. This is obvious with any electronic item that remains unused for such a long time3. Amazon is refusing to accept return or provide any form of support on the issue and I am expected to make rounds of Apple service center and spend hours chatting to support teams on a brand new phone that I have paid full price for4. As per Amazon's policy which is mentioned under a hidden tab Amazon will not return/replace this unless you receive a wrong product. So, in essence once you purchase you are on your own5. The entire point of purchasing online is the assurance that the product will be replaced in an unlikely scenario. If that assurance is taken away then buying online makes no sense considering you don't even get to physically see the product before purchasing6. My request to all the readers is to not purchase this product from Amazon and Appario as the policies are not clearly mentioned on the product page and there is no support provided in a genuine case7. After this experience, my trust in Amazon has gotten seriously impacted. I request other buyers to be doubly sure before placing trust on Amazon on expensive products",iPhone 7
"Life of this phone  less than 3 yrs,  Is any small parts got  faulted,  service center asked to replace complete display which cost around 15k,  is it worth to buy,  believe this is completely disappointed now,  was iPhone user from 2015 .IPhone being a company need to work on service center abs their manpower n provide them training to reduce cost of  service.",iPhone 7
This was a total waste of money. The gadget cannot hold any power and it is utter disappointing after spending so much money. Unfortunately the return window is closed and due to Covid lockdown I could not return it within the specified period,iPhone 7
It was getting warm in 30 mins of usage. There was an issue with the microphone too. I could hear some disturbance while on call. It was never clear audio. . Camera quality was poor. But Amazon accepted my return without enquiring much detail.5 Star for amazon1 star for the product.,iPhone 7
"Only 2-3 hours of battery life after full charging, please don’t buy this phone",iPhone 7
"I was so excited after reciving iphone. But i didn't feel anything better in iphone than android now after 3 years storage sucks literally. It has problem with volume. you can't even hear other person's voice untill unless you are on speaker. Same problem with friends phone too he bought with me same phone.  Everytime i have to put myself on speaker for even private talks. Storage is the biggest issue. If you have downloded something it automatically uninstall all the apps. When in need you have to wait for app install. I feels like m in the grandfathers era. One of the biggest disadvantage, It doesn't support any earphone, you have to buy original apple earphone. It is just a waste of money and time. you can't even talk to people while charging is on cuase of their so called one jack :(I will never buy iphone and won't even recommend anyone to buy because it is not worth the money. This made my life almost hell.",iPhone 7
Can’t hear the voice over the phone calls. Can’t believe Apple can produce such sick device that it won’t work with the basic need  to be fulfilled through a phone. I need this device to be thoroughly checked. Either Apple or Amazon is at fault.You guys wasted my 2 days time. It sucks. Who will bear the loss of time wastage for phone n data transfer etc? Refund immediately. Get it picked. Facing problem in transferring my whole data in previous device now.,iPhone 7
"This is my first iPhone.  So it took some time to get used to it.  But it is a different experience.Pros: Speed, Performance, iOS 13.2, Camera, Sound, Ear phone and DisplayCons: Battery (Even for moderate use, battery lasts hardly 10 to 12 hour) Very disappointing.",iPhone 7
"Overal good but what I got the ear phones , charger and data cable not brand of apple it was another one it was the bad experience with Amazon",iPhone 7
Nice product..however earpiece volume is little bit concern So some time I repent why I wasted 40k for just phone..also the abolition of 3.5mm jack also annoying (u will have to plug in plug out Digital to Analog converter if you missed ur original earphone which last up to just 6 or 8 months (wire cutting problem from jack ) also it tangles so much and u need 4-5 minutes to solve the puzzle before listening music.Good product specially camera is ultimate far far better than others 10 MP/20 MP.,iPhone 7
Sorry to say the product I received was not up to the mark that too from amazon who I trusted several years The phone I got is defective Everyone who calls me say neither audible or echo sound This is 1st time am posting a negative remark Deep regrets,iPhone 7
"Exchanged my HTC One A9 for this.  Both felt the same in my hand, which is a good thing. I definitely didn't want any of the ugly oversized phones that are so popular now. This phone is Sturdy. I dropped it a few times when traveling..once, right on its glass face from a height of ~3 feet. It fell down on one of those rough, jagged granite steps we see everywhere in India. Barely a scratch. In the last one year, my iPhone 7 has picked up a few tiny spots on the back where the paint has come off, but nothing that would take away from its great looks. This thing has survived a fair bit of abuse, without a phone case. Will hold on to this one a while longer because the newer X series phones are bulky and I read that they get scratched easily. Everything else is as expected on an iPhone - it all just works really well. If I had to nitpick, I'd say the fingerprint reader isn't the best in the market. If you are considering buying this, I highly recommend it.",iPhone 7
After receiving my item I checked battery health and it was 97 percent. In new phone it was impossible. I was sure that the item was an used one. Tried to replace the item several times but the link was not working for replace. Then I contacted with Amazon by telling that the product is not as per description of Amazon. Hence want to replace it. After 18 days when I am able to contact with customer care I am informed it is my own fault. Thanks both Amazon and Apple for selling a used item to me in the name of brand new item.,iPhone 7
Using it for more than one month no problems at all iOS 11 is still has some bugs others than that phone works perfectlyBattery life is very good giving around 5.30 screen on time with mobile data is turned on all the timeGo for it if you want a good all round phoneBut the lack of headphone jack can be over come by a good wireless headset,iPhone 7

The display keeps flickering. I can hear it ringing but cant see anything on the display. I don’t thi k this would have been a good place to purchase such high end, costly products. I would suggest you to prefer stores rather than going for online with amazon or this seller. I have been trying to reach them and couldn’t get any response.",iPhone 7
I got this phone 10 days before just to have a premium quality phone for the long run but the Heating issue are very high on this phone (a lot more if compared from 6s) Build quality is Good but the Charged stopped working in 2 days itself.Overall Not worth of 30k.Apple support is also not satisfactory and will suggest to Go for some Android options if the max you wanna spend is 25k-30k.Overall All not at all satisfied with the phone expected a decent phone but multiple issues are making it below average.,iPhone 7
I buy this phone but it is overheating .when i want to return this item they didn't accepted. The behaviour of amazon panipat hub maanager is also not good . I recommend to buy the product from flipkart .,iPhone 7

"Battery is getting discharged at a very fast pace. Have been directed to approach Apple iStore for the resolution. Not happy with the revert from Apple as well. they have heard the issue patiently but did not get any resolution, they just say to update to the latest version and performance will be good.",iPhone 7
"I have an entire cavalry of Apple products at my place - macbook air, pro, iMac, iPad - and none of the above mentioned products have disappointed me, even when the usage is on a higher end.  I stay in the US and since I couldn't personally send an iPhone to my dad I used Amazon (dot) in's service and it has been a very disappointing experience. The phone heats up even when no third party application has been installed. Without no usage the battery drains out of power and I am pretty confident that this phone has been unboxed before. But keeping the allegations aside, PLEASE DON'T BUY FROM AMAZON rather buy from an APPLE STORE instead. It might be a little costly or your city might not have an apple store at the first place but it will save you the disappointment of putting so much amount of money into something and not reaping the benefits.Also, I would like to mention that for my family I also bought an iPad with the same purchase, which is working in a great shape and there is no functional defects but 50% of your purchase turns out to be faulty is a big RED flag.",iPhone 7

We are very frustrated with this, Made in China phone that simply we want to stop using it. Many of the less known products are being reported to be far better than this one.I gave all one stars for other bundled products I bought with this one as I simply feel that Amazon is selling bad products on its website without any quality feed or checks. I am going to talk to Amazon to return this phone and feed more comments after that.",iPhone 7
"Most useless product sold by Appario retail on Amazon platform. Opened the box. No power. Charged the battery, phone heated. After 2 hours, phone is dead. It is not powering on..

I mainly brought it because i have ipad and airmac and wanted to be able to airdrop but the important thing, that it picks up signal from phone is actually pretty poor.",iPhone 7
"What do I say? You know how this phone is. Aluminium back, Taptic 3D touch, taptic home button differentiate this from 6s and 8. In my opinion, this is the best out of the 3 overall.

"I received a defective phone from amazon with faulty battery plus some problem with the device (it does not recognise the network .... no towers/ network bars). order phone for 28,000 on 27th Feb and raised request for reutun 8 days later....but amazon hasn't picked till now... really feel cheated. Had to buy another phone...shame on amazon!",iPhone 7
this is a 4-5 year back technology ... even then latest flagship android phones don't even come close to it ...excellent phone ....,iPhone 7
"Camera, finger print reader, screen quality are good, premium quality body . Major disappointment is battery it discharging in 1 day even after doing battery optimisation, dark background , turn off location etc. Always carry power bank or charger while going out. At this cost expected battery to be little bit better at least 2 days in full charge.",iPhone 7
the phone is switched off still the charging is 80% left and it doesn't getting on and Amazon doesn't giving me refund,iPhone 7
"It’s a Great Product, buy it without thinking twice.The 4.7’ inch isn’t too small, it is the perfect mobile screen size in the world! Just buy it!!!",iPhone 7
"This is my 1st iPhone , got it more for business use. It's super smooth, no hiccups so far, have been using this since around over 4 months. Camera is good enough, though not great at low lights. I got this for 35k on Amazon sale, For all those wanting to try out an iPhone and have never done befote, it's a good start with iPhone 7, won't disappoint you.",iPhone 7
This is a still a phone worth buying in 2018. Apple still has the best LCD display in the market. Sound quality is great. Phone is lag free because of the constant updates from Apple. This is one of the important reasons why you should buy an iPhone. When both the hardware and software is managed by the same company you can expect the phone to keep up with time unlike many other phone manufacturers who stop with out of the box software. The main con is battery life. To provide a sleek phone Apple cuts on battery size and hence don’t expect too much of on screen time if you’re a gaming enthusiast or watch a lot of videos on phone. The stand by time however is great because of the latest software update. Overall a good phone to experience the Apple space.,iPhone 7
Everything Is perfect it’s good to carry but network capacity is low while after the call come to 3G and take time to update in 4G after disconnecting the call.Another thing is take approx 2 hour to full charging it’s too much timeAnd last thing is battery life it’s give you hole day with single charge for general usage,iPhone 7
Had iphone6 and now I have upgraded to iphone7. Was able to see the difference immediately. iphone 7 is much faster than iphone6. Picture clarity is better. Both camera and selfie camera are excellent.  Battery life is almost as similar as iphone6. All this combined with Amazon superfast delivery as well. Good Value for money. We can go for it.,iPhone 7
"My 2nd iPhone 7 till date...love the compact size of the phone and the premium feel of the aluminium body.Battery life is the major draw back..moderate use will leave you with 20% by the end of the day(FB,chatting,instagram) ..not for heavy media users.Cameras ,both front n back are good but a bit  over saturated.Speaker volume decent.Performance top notch.4/5 for this.",iPhone 7
"Very bad experience with apple, I bought 1st time i phone but phone home botton is not working, when I replace phone, apple didn't replace order, they told me, go over service center, phone is not replace, I never suggest anyone of my friend for buying I phone, my 1st and last experience with apple we're  very very very bad",iPhone 7

Amazon gave me defective product. I tried to switch on the iPhone 7 many times but I failed then I contacted customer care.

The employee of this company is not working truely i think they are exchange the product in the midway. I am facing the problem to return iphone 7. Please do not purchage any product from amazon,iPhone 7
Worst experience ever...Phone dead with in 24 hours. Seller not provided any support.We have to go to apple service centre.They will repair and give it back. No replacement at all. Don’t buy it..Now onwards I will rethink before buying expensive items from Amazon.I was very happy with Amazon so far. This seller spoiled that...!!!,iPhone 7
My new I phone battery health showing 96% while my one year old I phone 6 showing 99%....and it is getting hot while using the mobile data very hot ...when checking the hardware the small screw between the charging pot seems to open ...the black paint in the screw and surrounding are cracked ...I strongly feel some battery replaced done with the distributor ...I given a complaint at Apple due to lock down no shop are open ...,iPhone 7
Hopeless product with no battery backup,iPhone 7
"Unable to See al callers name when restart the mobile, Battery overheating, Many more technical issues. Manufacturing is November 2019. Don't buy and waste your money. May be Amazone selling refurbished mobile.",iPhone 7
Pros:1. Handy2. Memory management3. Idle time battery managementConsScreen to body ratio could be better.... (But that is already there from iphone x but have to pay almost double),iPhone 7
An amazing product when compared to other phones other phones on the stand with similar specifications. The phone is as described by the seller and hence there is no need to repeat the specs. But being water resist is a good thing and always a desirable feature.,iPhone 7
"The iPhone 7 is a very good quality phone. I love the fact that its screen is 4.7 inches as this means it can fit into my pocket very comfortably. The display is also very good. The software updates about a week or so after the phone is registered with an Apple ID. The touch screen is smoother than my roomie's HTC phone which apparently cost 40,000 (I bought this for 30,000 just before the launch of iPhone 11, which pushed the price down to about 27,000). All in all, this is not a decision that I regret.",iPhone 7
I bought it on 9th june 2020 and kept in charge for 5 minutes and heating effect started..... (After Month updating my reviews ) This piece is early model of this brand. so it has very bad functional capabilities like less battery backup and easy to hang because of little RAM and if your shifting from  Android to iOS then i suggest you to not to switch because with this price you get the Best mobiles in Android or may be less price,iPhone 7
Phone is not getting switched on. Raised so many messages and did not receive any update still. I did not expect this from amazon,iPhone 7
"Was little nervous after ordering it coz i saw some negative feedback AFTER PLACING THE ORDER. I thought i would probably get an OLD phone or a BRICK delivered instead of a new phone, whereas all of that Phantasmagoria was vanished as i have received a brand new phone which works perfectly well. Not too sure why people left those negative comments. Would suggest all interested buyers to go ahead give it a shot as its worth the money you would pay. By the way i also order a Cover and a Screen-guard later as i was sure that i wont get bricks anymore. Lol cheers",iPhone 7
I am a bit apprehensive for new iPhones(assembled in India)  from appario retails. There are good deals but my current phone got dead(seems motherboard issue) just a bit more than a year's time/warranty expired.I am using my 4-year iPhone 5s (assembled in China) as a backup which is still as rock-solid as possible.,iPhone 7

purchased iPhone 7 within 24 hrs of usage the display went off.. showed at service center informed hardware faulty. awaiting for proper response from Amazon. Seller has supplied with faulty phone... Amazon is sitting there to fool people and they don't even bother to help customers within the warranty,iPhone 7

"The phone is quite slick and nice! I believe for someone who is looking for a functional and compact handset this is a good bet and doesn’t bite your walllet. Though it lags when it’s comes to sound output, pictures features/clarity options, but it’s packed with goodness. Battery life is a little disappointing, but that with all iPhones.",iPhone 7
"Reading some of the negative reviews i was scared to order this phone from Amazon. But going with the trust with Amazon, my  belief was not shattered for sure.

"I shouldn’t have ignored the 1-star reviews. Everything happened just like those reviews. 1. Phone heats up easily 2. It started once and still off since then 3.

But when I saw Apple 7 I felt like buying the product without seeing the features of the product, it's bit costly, but it is good.Picture quality is good, sound quality is good and the touch is very smooth, more over Siri feature is awesome and it is tooo fast for fetching the details.The only dislike I have with apple is you have to buy the APP'S and they are bit costly.",iPhone 7

"Good choice to have iPhone 7 but the little concern is with its battery backup.My suggestion to all is that there is not so much difference between iPhone 7 and 8 because the picture quality, sound quality and other features are same in both models.

"Firstly, let me clarify.. I do not belong to Apple Die hard fans and followers' club.I too was drawn towards this device as a replacement when my Moto E First Gen one fine day stopped working and didn't recover.So this is a transition from Android to iOS.Am I missing Android ? Honestly - NO.I thought it's time to buy a perfect and latest device for myself, not because I was completely sure of what it does, just because I could now afford it.I know, iPhone 8 and iPhone X are in the market today. But this phone in every respect is still relevant today and in no way can be considered outdated. If you wish you buy an iPhone that doesn't hit your pocket much and is not outdated, this is the most perfect phone to buy today.Buying 6 or 6s would be a risk because apple might stop supporting its update in a few years.As I mentioned, this review is not from a crazy Apple product lover. (Although it may sound like one)Pros:1. The screen dimensions and phone size is perfect. It's exactly what I need. Not too thick and not extremely flimsy. Though some might prefer the iPhone 7 plus, I think it's too big to carry in your pocket.2. Processor and Speed: this I noticed not just about this iPhone but for iPad also, the processor speed is really awesome. Windows laptops, android phones and tabs do hang and freeze. This phone in last one year has NEVER. It might not sound much of a big deal but usually phones hang when you desperately need them in urgency and you don't want to be in that position ever.3. Screen Quality: the screen looks amazing and Colors are extremely fine.4. Camera: now please note that this is not a DSLR. So no matter how much the phone companies advertise, phone cameras will always be inferior to a professional DLSR. That's the reason why camera companies aren't out of business. Having said that, the camera of this phone (both front and back) are really good and they do their job.6. No Headphone Jack: I thought it would be a matter of concern, but it isn't. It has only motivated me to take care of my headphone even more and that's the only reason they are still intact and working properly. I am sure you won't miss the jack. Besides, if you fear losing the small adapter, it's better to buy Bluetooth headphones. They fit it really well with this phone.7. Cross platform flexibility: this is what I was most worried about. How this device would blend in with my windows laptop and all other apps and features which I earlier used in windows and Android. Surprisingly, the transition was smooth and hassle free. There may be people who disagree, but I never missed any feature which android provided. Infact, itunes, iCloud and other apple features have made the life much easier as compared to android.8. 32 GB storage: I think it's sufficient today. Most people use their phones as storage devices. If you're one of them then even 256GB variant is not enough. So install the apps you actually use, backup the photos in to your laptop regularly, put videos and songs only the ones you listen and actually watch. You will surprise yourself that filling up 32GB space is also difficult.Now, most importantly...CONS:1. Body Finishing: You have to have a back cover for this phone in order to avoid it slipping from your hands. The tighter you grip it without cover, the easily it would slip.Also, I initially used a cover which had a seive pattern on it. The same pattern got imprinted on back of the phone (though not easily visible). Go for an all solid or all plastic cover which can provide grip.2. Battery backup: The battery backup of this phone is bit of a problem. With moderate usage also, it can consume battery before the end of the day and you have to be very economical about it.3. No dual sim: I know, many would frown after reading this. And I know why Apple has still not released a dual sim iPhone.. but I wish this phone was dual sim. The other 2 cons can be mitigated, this one however can only be settled by having a backup phone. Add the Dual sim feature and apple would bring in a swarm of new users who hesitated from iPhone.iPhone ACCESSORIES RECOMMENDATION1. Screen Guard: you may go for any standard screen guard but honestly you don't need one. No screen guard can protect your screen from breaking. I have not used any screen guard for more than year and the screen looks as new. Just make sure you don't put the keys and phone in the same pocket and surely phone will shine for years. Also, let me mention here that my phone HAS FALLEN from a decent height face down on solid floor twice but the glass is strong enough to sustain without absolutely no physical damage.2. Back cover: I think this is a must accessory. You need not spend much on this. Egotude transparent color (black shade) will go perfectly with it. It provides the necessary grip and scratch resistance to your phone back.3. Headphones: in case you lose your Apple earphones, as per your budget, buy a Bluetooth headset, something that suits your pocket and you're good to go.4. Cleaning Spray and Cloth: If you wish to keep your phone new and clean, please invest in this. It's a very small investment but the returns are huge. Buy any camera lens cleaning Spray and soft cloth. Every 10-15 days, take the phone out of cover and thoroughly clean the phone and cover as well. Your phone will shine a little longer and will look brand new for years. All it needs is just a little touch of care from you.Hope the review helps. Cheers 🖖🏻",iPhone 7
The phone started giving trouble in 5 months after purchase and Apple refused to honour the warranty. Simply refused perhaps as it was purchased from AmazonThe complaint with Amazon is pending for redressal.,iPhone 7
"Overview - On the outside, the new iPhone looks basically the same as the iPhone 6/6s. They are now water resistant, which is nice, although they’re not fully waterproof, keep them submerged in a meter of water for more than 30 minutes and things might not go your way.Once you wrap your head around the missing audio jack (it's not the end of it, you can get a designated adapter for your favorite headphones), the Apple iPhone 7 is a major upgrade. IP67-certified water-resistant body. Bigger and brighter camera with OIS. New FaceTime cam. Stereo speakers. Faster processor and 50% GPU performance increase, more RAM. New pressure-sensitive Home key powered by a new taptic engine. Revised storage options.Battery - iPhone 7 is powered with the newest A10 Fusion chip. It is a quad core processor which helps in better managing the battery life. It takes around 2hrs to completely charge from 0-100% and the battery usually lasts a day. I am a heavy user, and use the phone quite a lot during the day. Whatsapp, Twitter, Calling and Messaging are the main battery draining apps for me. I will be left with 20-25% battery at the end of the day with typical usage.Performance - Apple made the best mobile chipset from which others can only learn from. Its dual-core processor, even without the help of the tiny energy efficient cores, beats any other processor out there. The A10 GPU is equally impressive acing every graphic benchmark. The iPhone 7 is the fastest and most powerful smartphone in the world as of now.Audio - iPhone 7 has stereo speakers, considering my previous iPhone was the 5s, it is a huge upgrade for me in the audio performance. Loudspeaker is pretty good, audio output is loud and clear. Call quality is damn good.Camera - The colors and contrast are great and the dynamic range is simply great - much like you would get on dedicated big cameras. In any case, the iPhone 7 delivers the most balanced dynamic range from any smartphone at the moment. The optical image stabilization is the addition that really matters as it will keep the lens steady and won't allow for blurry shots at low-light. The front-facing camera got its resolution boosted to 7MP and records 1080p video. It can use Retina flash, where your screen lights up in different colors depending on the intended white balance of the scene. Pretty good when taking selfies in dark environment. Coming to the 4k video recording, it is the best camera when it comes to 4k Video, Period.Overall a great package and the phone will definitely last 3+ years if used carefully. There won't be any performance issues considering Apple will provide updates regularly and the phone won't lag after using it for a year or so unlike the android phones. The phone is also water and dust resistant, if we accidentally end up dropping the phone in water, there is no need to worry. The phone can even be used to take pictures in swimming pool and shallow water(Be careful with the depth of water else phone will be toast). Putting a case and a screen protector will ruin the beauty of phone and the phone won't feel the same, but if you are the one who drops the phone constantly then Case and Screen protectors are necessary evils. I got it for a price of 36500/- in the Great Indian Sale :pAbsolutely Loving it !!",iPhone 7
"Delivery was on time, product is legit with a proper Indian warranty as well.But the iPhone 7 I got has a 'microphone' issue, giving a hissing sound in the voice calls and video recordings... Trying to sort out with the apple service care, though they r taking a long time",iPhone 7
"Product meet my expectation but when I saw within 2 days after my shopping the prices has fallen down Like anything, I feel not good. Price of my product reduces from Rs. 46900 to Rs. 40000. I have loses nearly Rs. 6000/-.",iPhone 7
Excellent phone. Light weight and classy. I was only worried about a refurbished iphone being sold as new. But the phone was new and am very  happy about it. It arrived early too. Worth buying it during the shopping festival.Only challenge would be to move data from the old phone which I think no one has mastered yet.,iPhone 7
"it is been 10 moths now, i'm still in love with my I phone7. never went slow, best picture taken, best ever display... dont think much.. if yo decided for i Phone buy it now :).it's design, color, everything is top of this world.Thank you Apple for making this beautiful/ awesome /gorgeous yet best gadget in the world.:)",iPhone 7
"The Good: The iPhone 7 has the biggest key features anyone want: a fast processor, water resistance, a more durable solid-state home button, and still really good cameras with rear optical image stabilization. iOS 12 is help this phone to perform even better than on iOS 11.The Bad:Lacks the extra speed and improved camera quality of the iPhone 8. No fancy Face ID or other iPhone X-type designs. No headphone jack (an adapter comes in the box). No wireless charging.The Bottom Line:The gap between iPhone 8 and iPhone 7 isn’t as great as I think, and for the right price, this is still an excellent pick if you’re not chasing the latest bleeding-edge iPhone and want to save some money.",iPhone 7
Nice mobile but after iOS 11 updates its started to hang and performance is slow battery life is also not that good can only use for 4-5 hrs and it needs to be charger overall it’s a good but costly product  but not at all value for money. I am writing this review after one year of use and yes it’s water proof but after it’s splashed with water it’s speaker 🔊 doesn’t work you have to make sure that all the water 🚿 has been removed or leave it for 30-40 min then only you can have clear sound all in all product is good but not at all value for money 10-15 k is added to its price for nothing,iPhone 7
"Belated delivery and phone is dead now . Within a one month , how can an apple iPhone can be dead without any physical damage ... it is jolting ...",iPhone 7
"Hahah when it comes to writing ,I am lazy. Still I must say, it's a wonderful piece of art. And I must be one among those lucky people who got iPhone 7 at a price of 43824/- on 1st July and next day they revised price to 47k and finally to 49k.Best thing: Camera: Live option is pretty cool,Battery, Fingerprint. Processor speedBad thing : it's been a month and am yet to find one. Cool. Just buy and you gonna love the user interface. Coz I am using android also, last week one of my colleague gave her Lenovo to download some app, I must say I took 5 minutes to find play store in that phone. Here things are streamlined, and android to apple data transfer, perfect. :) Delighted customer",iPhone 7
"Got the iPhone 7 for 43K on Prime Day Sale. Have been using it for almost a month now. It came in authentic Apple box. Checked all the contents inside after opening. All genuine. Mine was shipped by Cloudtail. The experience has been sublime so far.I'm a convert, from Android to iOS. The first thing that struck me after using the phone for the very first time was that it's super user friendly. The M10 processor is the fastest processor on a smartphone yet. It's capable of performing endless tasks in one go. I didn't even bother to switch off any background apps for a few days. It's damn fast. Also, the iPhone is built in such a way that it can extract the maximum juice out of its hardware. Its 2GB RAM is more than capable of performing all your tasks without any fuss.The camera is impressive too. The pictures have minimum noise. The details are pretty sharp. I've seen a better camera phone than this though (OnePlus 3/3T, for instance).The stereo speakers are one of the best speakers in a smartphone right now. Their performance is awesome. The sound gives a theatre like feel to the music. The EarPods are great too. I'd recommend to set the volume at 50% though. They can get pretty loud.The battery backup is decent enough. My phone lasts the entire day on full charge. I only charge it once in 24 hours. Lasts about 2/3rd of the day on mixed usage (browsing, video playback, music).All in all, it's a worthy investment as you'll get updates for three years and the hardware is capable enough to last that long.Also, get a solid case for protection from slips as it's a bit on the slippery side. Spigen is a good option.Go for it if you've been thinking of switching loyalties.",iPhone 7
the product was defective and i could not use the phone,iPhone 7
"Not satisfied with the product. Communication is not proper. Very difficult to hear voices to callers, very low voice heard. Need to resolve this issue.",iPhone 7
Delivered in good condition under exchange. Working well. Truly a phone with lots of features. Experience is far better than Android with amazing picture quality that matches good cameras. Easy to install and transfer from old Android phone than before.,iPhone 7
"Good phone but go for iPhone 7plus if you can..Camera and audio both are good but battery could have been slightly bigger May be 2500 mAhIn heavy use with gaming and internet battery lasts for 4 to 4.5 hrs. If not used, after a full charge  battery will be around 95 to 92 % after 8 hrs..Screen size is bit small compared to other phones therefore phone is also small and very slim..make sure that u purchase cover immediately after purchasing phone..it is bit slippery..I purchased for 39500 at time of Amazon flash sale..processor is quite fast and no lags during heavy gaming can be noticed..Front camera is also good..Still I will suggest to go for iPhone 7 plus if you are bot tight on budget..I'm posting this review after 2 months use..Thanks",iPhone 7
"The phone is as good as it looks. The feel, the performance and the style all compliment each other..!The camera is just perfect and gives you the click you deserve..!People might say that an iPhone does not have the additional features an Android has, for all those I would simply say....""If you don't have an iPhone you don't have an iPhone.""Go for it without a second thought..!",iPhone 7
"spot on, was worried buying it online, but it turned out to be a wise decision to save some money.got the product checked from apple service centre and they confirmed its genuine and you have got 364 days of warranty left. don't know why so much negativity for online shopping platforms.packaging could have been better, must have wrapped the product in bubble sheet.overall satisfied.",iPhone 7
"battery draining problem i have found and overall good product , User experience is very good , User interface is nice , don’t buy from amazon because their policy is changing instantly after purchasing the product,you can buy from Flipkart or Paytm if you want to save time and money",iPhone 7
"This was the first iPhone that I have owned but I  have gone through a lot of iPhones in the past. One the best phones I have seen in recent times. The build quality, the smoothness with which it works and the features it has is just simply superb. The camera is so good that it can almost compete with a DSLR. Thank you Amazon... I was a little upset with the packaging of the product as it was shabby but the iPhone box was not damaged.",iPhone 7
"I received a faulty device at first. Upon complaining I got the device replaced within 24 hours. Have been using it since last year and a half and am very much satisfied with the iPhone 7.Below review was posted on which I got an instant responseI received the phone in a seal packed box but haven’t received Ear Pods with Lightning Connector (wired), Lightning to 3.5mm Headphone Jack Adapter. Plus the volume in the speaker is too low to listen.",iPhone 7
"This is my 1st ever Apple purchase for me. Till now I don't have any complaints but if you compare 1 to 1 features with any of the premium phones available in the market. It lags behind. You can buy it if you want a brand name, security, and fast phone. If you want a bright screen, better battery backup, premium looks and loaded with features then this phone is not for you.Pros:- If compared with previous version - Improved cameras (Front and Rear), screen and battery life.- Faster than any other smartphone available.- Water resistance- Powerful dual speakers (Better than any other phone)- Good Storage space.Cons:- Iterative design- Many of the ""groundbreaking"" features have been on Android phones for a while.- It's expensive if features are compared with another premium phone.",iPhone 7
"Guys big problem with iphone 7, have yellowish screen problem with many users. Just checked on google. Mine too have yellowish screen and bad camera due to this. However phone is gr8. Amazon please help ke what to do",iPhone 7
Do not buy apple products from amazon. They are giving defective products and more over they are not taking responsibility. They are not involving the dealer.AMAZON is not authorized re seller of apple products.Amazon gave an iphone with manufacturing defect. I reported the issue the immediate day after your return period.  Why the dealer Darshitha electronics is not coming in to picture at all. I will make more sound in social media and increase awareness to people not to buy iphone/apple products from Amazon. (If you are ok to loose your reputation I will try my best to increase the awareness),iPhone 7
"The packing of the product was very poor, infant the seal was broken, After writing numbers of email to Amazon only answer was ""As your issue has already been escalated to our higher authorities, they will surely take certain measures, so that no other customer should face the same issue"". But no action has been taken in favor of customer who has already faced this problem.",iPhone 7
"Using iPhone 7 from last 9 months and my experience is amazing either in terms of user interface or camera or sound or the most important it’s speed. Even 4 or 6 gb of android may not have processing as fast as iPhone.Battery life is also good but the only drawback is it’s heating a little bit if I use it in temperature that go beyond the recommended range for its surrounding temperature.Rest everything is good. If you want to buy iPhone 7 in 2018, it’s worth buying.",iPhone 7
Got a phone which was already used for 21 hrs.  I'm not able to even access the App Store . It's stuck ..Got it on the sale day for the exchange of my old phone . Regret the decision. Worst experience.,iPhone 7
"Bought it for my wife, delivered in time, delivered properly and works fantastically. Compared it with my 6s Plus and this is a more refined product. I found that the sound output was much louder than the 6s plus, the camera is great and the phone works like a hot knife through butter, smooth and unfettered. An excellent phone.",iPhone 7
Defective product. Got the refund after a long ordeal.,iPhone 7
"It is a really nice phone!!!Very nice to hold and looks good!!Missing the 3.5mm jack though!!Came factory sealed and on timeOne important thing to know if your phone is genuine factory sealed or not is to check whether the box has a small flap below it,The flap is pulled to break the seal and the phone can be unboxed after that.(You can check various unboxing videos on youtube for the same)If the seal does not have the flap do not accept it.it means its tampered",iPhone 7
Defective product delivered by Greenmobiles.Left bottom corner of the phone producing inappropriate colors.,iPhone 7
"It’s really good but it heated up in the first month and I didn’t see the problem after that. My friend had the same problem in the first month. The battery backup is not great. Other than that, everything is awesome and it’s handy.",iPhone 7
Truly a class product by appleThe camera is upto the mark. Full marks to the image stabilization. You get clear pictures even with a shaky handGreat Ram management even at 2GB.

The product is defective new problems occur every few days now have to visit apple store for replacement .Never expected this when buying an Iphone 7.,iPhone 7
Product is good and I had paid through my credit card of Standard Chartered Bank and I have paid in scheme of 6 instalments interest free which was offered by Amazon at the time of payment but my bill of credit card is showing that there that I have to pay the full amount and there is no interest free instalment. I will request Amazon to look into this matter and inform me.,iPhone 7
"Superb phone at excellent 39 k price. It has been carved as a general perception that ios offers less as compared to similarly priced android but the truth is ios is far more advanced and litter free and secure,etc. Once you start using ios you would never feel like using an android phone ever again in your life. The only area where android wins is bigger battery life that too has been optimized with ios11. Actually ios11 has bridged all major gaps in ios that were present based upon which people used to create the false impression that ios is inferior to android.",iPhone 7
Product performance is not good.Gets hangup while switchng calls and also snoozing alarms. No reply from seller when applied for return.,iPhone 7
"Phone is brand new, but came with a scratch on the top. That's unbelievable how a scratched product packed in sealed box. Checked warranty online which is valid till 30th Dec 2018. Phone was turned on at 31st Dec 2017. Warranty is correct.",iPhone 7
I have purchased iPhone 7 from amazon and writing this review after 3 months of usage. I have bought this from amazon certified vendor based the cus reviews. The phone was perfectly fine for the first 2 months and suddenly one day when kept for charging while battery was 26% after 10 minutes there’s was so much of heat and mobile got switched off. Even after several attempts couldn’t not switch on. Not even the mobile restore with iTunes. I have submitted the phone to Apple service centre and got the replacement new phone. This new one is really superb and working fine for the past one month.Initially there would be some difficulties use for longtime android users but after couple of week you Wil love it.,iPhone 7
I got the 7 at lowest price. Its been 3 months now and Iam more than happy with the product i bought from Amazon. I would like to thank Amazon India for their incredible product services.About the phone:Design- As always the niche product that apple holds.Camera- Impressive clearer dimensions with 7 MP selfie add to the curve.Memory- For non gamers its the hit.OS- Very fast and smooth running.Rating- 9.5 out of 10,iPhone 7
Well it's an iphone :)The delivered product was genuine and has been working fine for the last 5 odd months.Have not tested the water proofing/resistance of it but I did have some artificial snow fall on it without any damage.I bought a screen guard just to be safe.,iPhone 7

"I  received the product on 16th oct. But it's heating up very badly. I was doing video call for 2 minutes., And it heated up so badly, that I had to hang up the call. It's a faulty product.from day one, it's heating up, even if a single app is open. I have kept the location service, and other privacy settings off. But still it doesn't solve the problem. I want a replacement/return/exchange immediately. Feels like cheated, while buying it during amazon sale. I have already talked to customer service. But looks like return is a long process. Please do the needful ASAP, to keep the trust of your customer.",iPhone 7

The product gets unresponsive and lags. The charger gets heated up. The box was sealed but looked old. The manufactured date was march 2017. And I bought the product in September. It was old. The system errors are prominent but don’t show up when given to a service provider. I have video’s and screenshots of the device freezing for like 15 mins and it got switched off. And did not turn on even after pressing the power button. It rebooted after 30 mins by itself. It was my worst online shoping experience. I bought iphone 7 32gb black.,iPhone 7

My first i phone. Looks premium. Very smooth and handy. Battery runs for hours in 1 charge. Camera is fabulous. Colour of photos are like real.,iPhone 7
The model itself is very slippery to hold so cover was mandatory. The first upgrade to 11.2 crashed and had to restore to factory settings. When I read about Jio plan to give the Iphone 8 at 18K felt like a fool for buying this model. Note I am a Apple fan.,iPhone 7

"The most overrated phone. After one year of use - Speaker not working, memory is full. the IOS version update leads to low sound.Full of bugs, yet people like me bought it because of Apple's marketing. I wish there was a rating less than one.Steve Job's sold his products in third world countries at a price higher than US/EU prices. Karma came back to him. Just recall how he passed away.Thumbs down to iPhone 7",iPhone 7

"Apple iPhone 7 (Black, 32GB)

Review for Apple IPhone 7 - 32GB - Purchased during the last sale of Amazon at a cost of rs. 39,999 . The cost seemed to be on a higher side initially, however since I have been using Android for last 4-5 years, and already made my mind to move from Android , so I had no choice if I wanted to upgrade. There were two choices Apple 6s and Apple IPhone 7. I chose 7 since this was a higher version with improved processor as compared to 6s.Well, actually IPhone 7 does not need a review, however since I generally review every product I buy from Amazon, this is again the same.Not going much with the Specs, the first thing I noticed is that this phone never hangs as compared to the recent Android Nougat which stands no where in comparision to IOS 11. IOS 11 is much stable than Nougat. IOS used 2 GB ram very effectively which an Android phone with 4 GB Ram also could not use it very optimised. The IPhone can multitask easily, the applications can run in background without affecting the performance of the application which is in foreground. This does not impact the application you are using currently. Well, coming to the delivery, the Amazon Prime delivery was amazing , the phone was delivered within 48 hours of the order. This is so far the most stable phone I have used.1. Not bulky.2. The screen is 4.7 inches, fits easily in your pocket.",iPhone 7

"Received the iphone 7 in good and excellent condition. As it was brand new phone. However, surprised to not see the warranty specified on the website. Need immediate support and adviceI just have the invoice which does not state anything about the 1 year warranty on phone and 6 months towards accessories",iPhone 7
"First of all i would like to thanks amazon for their fast delivery, they delivered My iPhone within 24 hours...And as i used My iPhone 7 32 GB phone only few days so, i can't describe more but till now every thing is awesome i found in comparison to android phones, since i was using android phone from last 6 years.My views:1. 2GB RAM is more then sufficient because iPhone manufacturers and developers has done good job to maintain background processes.2. Nice thouch.3. Awesome Camera, front and rear both.4. All day battery backup on JIO 4G Network.5. Awesome music sound.6. Takes 2 hours to charge from 0 to 100%(which should be fast).Thanks again amazon...",iPhone 7
"Phone has some software issues. I am trying to reach amazon customer care but i am not able to reach out to talk to customer care agent.  problems like hanging,heating, slow and many other minor issues.. Not happy with iphone 7. Some of my Friends also returned Iphone 7 with in a month.",iPhone 7

"I bought apple 7 phone from Amazon, within two months the colour started peel off from ringer button and top of the phone. They sell a old mobile phones i guess. When I contacted customer service regarding the issue, they can't help me in anyways and they simply advised me to contact Apple Store. I have got them denial letter as well as they have instructed. But no help finally. Unsatisfactory with product n customer service .",iPhone 7
"iPhone 7 -  What can I say here that hasn't been said before about the awesomeness of this apple's beauty.While iPhone 8 & X are now available in the market, the iPhone 7 continues to be one of the best buys.  If I compare the 7 with the other phones in the market, it is so much elegant and has one of the best camera quality.  I totally love this phone, the LED display is beautiful, the colors on screen are bright and perfect.There are good differences compared to 6 & 6S and not many differences compared to 8 & X (this one doesn't have augmented camera or wireless charging) but everything looks similar and the same.Yes, the headphones jack point is now officially gone from iPhone 7 and I don't see this a major issue except now you need to be alot more careful with your iPhone headphones.",iPhone 7
"Confused if to buynor not!! People giving half and half things , some say it’s good some say it’s defective, having a fear to buy it",iPhone 7
"I had to move out of my Android LG Nexus 5 to Apple iPhone due to security vulnerability on Android which caused my company to block emails on Android phones which don't have latest patches from Google. Google stops patching phones 3 yrs from launch.I had heard so much about iPhone and I decided to go for it since there is no security issue and people using iPhone 5c are also still getting patches.While it was delivered on time, I wasn't happy with first impressions for the following reasons:1) Move to iOS app wasn't working and had a tough time getting stuff migrated.2) Phone is getting very hot within minutes of powering on. I can't hold this phone in hand for few minutes. This phone is way too expensive to have these kind of issues.3) I am used to ""OK Google"" giving me fantastic search results. This ""Hey Siri"" is giving vague and stupid results.4) It's taking way too long to charge.I expected more from Apple, I am going to return this phone and get a Google Pixel.",iPhone 7
"I received this product on time. I even availed the exchange for my older iPhone so I got an amazing price. As for the phone well.... it exceeds all my expectations. This is my 3rd iPhone but I still haven't gotten bored of this. The design, speed and features beat any other phone on the market. If you're still deciding... GET THIS",iPhone 7
"In description there is clearly written ""1 year manufacturer warranty from date of purchase"". but apple warrenty portal showing 11 month warranty remaining. Means its a scam by Amazon. They are selling used product in name of new.",iPhone 7
"I bought this phone on big billion days , got it at great price.A genuinely new product and flawless delivery .",iPhone 7
"First of all, iPhone 7 nails it when it comes to battery. Being a high end smartphone, iPhone 7 shows amazing battery backup. This is my first iPhone and I was a heavy android user. I have used nexus devices, mi devices and also moto devices but the battery and RAM performance of iPhone 7 is above all of them. I keep my 4G data on all the time and I keep on chatting, watching videos online, downloading updates over mobile data and after all of these the battery remains at 20% at the end of my day (12:30 am).The display is awesome, touch response is buttery smooth. The removal of the 3.5 mm jack doesn't make much of a difference as you don't need to keep your phone at chcarging all the time.Talking about charging, though it doesn't bear the name of a quick charger but the lightning bolt in iPhone charges the device pretty quickly than any other traditional device.The service from Amazon is simply amazing and I must say I am very happy with my purchase. After spending an amount of 45k+, I am really happy with the output I get.",iPhone 7
"I had been using this phone for the past 7 months so can give you my perspective.I Had been using Android flagship( that too a nexus) for over past few years. And that nexus was unusable after 2 years.And on top of that Google stopped android updates after 2 yrs of phone's release which was main driving force for me to switch over to Apple.And that decision could never have been better.So coming to phone itself,it's amazing. Let's list them as pros and cons:Pros:1.UI is buttery smooth2. Camera is great with snappier response.3. Processor is way ahead of the Android counter parts.4. Many Ios apps are better optimized than.  android versions.5. Dust and water resistant. (IP67)6. Thin,light and amazing for one handed use.7. Great battery life can last you a day easily with moderate to heavy use.8. Future ios updates are guaranteed unlike in case of Android.9. Best IPS panel in the market with spectacular viewing angles.10. Call quality is best in class.Cons:1. Low resolution screen (720p)2. Kind of limited flexibility as compared to android (which is a trade of you have to make if u buy ios devices)",iPhone 7
Got it one day early. Awesome n genuine. Bought in sale so got good price too. Thanks Amazon for best price n fast delivery.,iPhone 7
Apple always a tech leader!The consistency of performance and provable quality makes its device stand out always.iPhone 7 is having fantastic camera which produces magnificent shots.iOS is top notch and gives great battery performance as well.Smooth and pleasing User Interface which gives pleasure using this smart phone.Being an Android user totally different and pleasing experience.Being received this product at Lightening deal at 39499 was a good shot.,iPhone 7
"I ordered the phone in morning and received it by evening. Amazing service from Amazon. Bout the phone. The experience is really good. I upgraded from 5s to 7. And the touch, feel, everything is amazing.",iPhone 7
It was not a original apple phone when i checked serial no on apple website it doesn't show any details and totally different back view shame on amazon for entertaining this type of products on amazon for fooling innocent customers very disappointed regarding this purchase and i have also missed deals on great India sale on amazon regarding this phone.,iPhone 7
"I got this phone delivered on 29th July and within 10 days it completely stopped working. It was dead and was not even charging, When I called Amazon they told me to visit apple care for warranty. I am waiting to see what apple will say about it. They have asked for 7 working days. Now I am without phone for 7 working days.",iPhone 7
Nice Phone.. Although missing my kidney as well 😂,iPhone 7
"The Apple  logo on the back of the phone is fading. I don't know why, and I can't really return this product as I have already opened my phone and accessories. So, ya disappointed with the product. Never thought it would happen.",iPhone 7
"Awsm feel after got my new i7 silver , as I want white one from Apple but it ' s more beautiful the I expect . Delivered to my home before time in 4 days . The screen is amazing like the text is showing above the screen  so crispy, and the 3D touch home button is really  awsm , it's feel like pressing a button but it's a touch one .Overall value for money for a premium user at this amazing price .",iPhone 7
"One month in the usage, the paint on the back panel started to come off and that too when I had it in a cover all the time. I am using a Matte Black finish. The company doesn't take any responsibility for the quality of surface finish that the phone has. There are quite a lot of users worldwide facing the same issue but the company has turned a blind eye to it. Shame that a company like Apple would do this to its customers. One expects a certain level of quality while purchasing a phone worth 50000 bucks.",iPhone 7
"while I was inserting it to the cart Flipkart was 43K,Ebay 42K, Paytm 40K including cashback.Even in amazon Except E seller price was 43.7K but I decided to go with E mobiles as the seller is the best reviewed in the past and present also.I am happy :)So while purchasing really I was worried about the bad reviews I could see.then I found the solution into decision making of seller selection.Go for it Guys. #HappyShoppingAmazon",iPhone 7
HiAm shocked to see my new iPhone 7 has a vertical line on the screen. It is a damaged piece. Am regular on amazon and this is a worst experience. Have no other option but to go to consumer court and recover my money. Will be publishing it on social media and make people aware of such things in amazon.,iPhone 7
"If you're going to buy a new iPhone, this is the one to get – there's a slightly longer battery life, a better camera, fast innards and protection against water. However, many of the changes are slight, and the iPhone 6S, for the lower price, suddenly becomes a very attractive option.FORGood low light cameraWater resistantDouble the internal capacityAGAINSTLacks clear upgradesSame design used for last three phonesBattery life unimpressive",iPhone 7

Black is beautiful...Pros1. Stunning look (if you love black colour)2. Front camera upgraded to 7mp3. Dual speakers are good4. Over all performance is better from predecessor (iphone 6s)Cons1.

Very Good mobile. Super smooth and iOS is very good Software. Seems difficult to switch to iOS all of a sudden but that's fine. Two to three days of working on it makes it easier. Over all good product and a genuine warranty( checked in apple site) buy only from cloudtail sellerPS: Delivery was fast and came earlier than expected. Good deal got it for 42k with all the offers and credit card discounts.,iPhone 7

"The best iPhone released by apple ever.Though price is lil high, apple has stick to their brand and quality.Specially mag back colors finishing and design is damn sexy. Phone feels like heaven in hand.Nice option to buy between 40-50 K",iPhone 7
"One of the best Apple products I have used so far. It's lightning fast with the 2GB RAM and the Taptic feedback on the Home button also feels good. However, the most alluring aspect of the device is its impeccable camera - from OIS technology to the aperture, everything combines to produce amazing images. Though the battery capacity could have been a little more, it surely makes up for that with its fast charging prowess.I recommend this phone to all who want to get a compact phone with a horde of features and beastly power.",iPhone 7

"Though I am a bit late to the apple party, this is zero nonsense device. The item supplied is 100% genuine and the same was verified with Apple Care as well. The best part was the item being delivered at lightning speed , full marks to Cloudtail there. Very much satisfied with the product and cheers to Amazon. :)",iPhone 7

what can say! this is Awesome ..... now I use Samsung and iPhoneios and android...

I was using a 6s prior to this.. but the iPhone 7 has lived more than expectations ! The stereo sound system is 2x louder than the 6s and is wayyyy better and louder than other smartphones..

Genuine product. I checked the apple site on warranty and its covered though its shipped from US.. Has a good battery life. Got a stellar deal.,iPhone 7
Iphone 7 design and performance is good but worst battery. Life of the battery is Only 3 hours. Apple company must give more capacity to its battery.we paid so much money to buy this but battery will spoil your iPhone life!. Don't buy if you are looking for good battery life. China mobiles battery life is better than this iPhone battery.,iPhone 7
there are already so many reviews on internet about the product. I am hoping if you are serious about buying you'd have already read those.,iPhone 7

phone is good phone but I don't like iOS that I am shifting to Android also it is not a quiet dynamic solution for many users iPhone and not all good but I don't know why people prefer that please save to Android Google play store is quite a dynamic thing app store doesn't have many applications like play store and also the applications are very bad in folder structure the interface is very low and the mobile is quite like the mobile fast you won't like this phone is actually very much bad. please by another Android phone in this budget thank you.also the mobile build is very poor you can see there is a very big at the top and at the end the site keys are also quite irritating and the switch and bottom is also very very bad I don't like that actually you can buy Samsung Vivo or any other Android at this price will get a very good mobile at this price actually thank you.,iPhone 7

"Pigeon Vegetables chopper started to give problem after 15 days from the date of purchase. It is not working. On contacting Amazon , they advised to go to manufacturer. On contacting manufacturer, they just gave mobile number of Technician. On contacting Technician, he said there is no service center at Dehradun so he will charge RS 150/-  for service charge. Cost of chopper is RS 285/- only and what is the logic to pay this amount.Rajesh Kanwar",iPhone 7

Awesomeness at its best,iPhone 7
U have gone through all the positive reviews about the phone. Here is my review.  Although display is only hd but has wider colour gamut. Top performance. Back camera is best in low light but selfie camera is average. Battery lasts one day with a single charge with normal usage.  But not insane.  3d touch and iOS software is improved compare to predecessor.,iPhone 7
the charger that came along is not recognised by the handset.,iPhone 7
Please don’t buy. I thought amazon is a trusted site which provides best customer service.But it failed.I bought this product and first day when I tried to charge my phone it started heating. And battery file after 100% charge is not even an hour which is suprizing to me. I have been using iphones from very long and never felt heat even on long usage. And the worst part here is it jus shows that it provides 10dys replacmnt but after I faced this issue tried to place a replacmnt request using the replacmnt feature its getting navigated to support page asking to contact apple customer service .I really don’t understand the use of replacmnt feature that this amazon has kept for the product. Hell with this product and amazon service,iPhone 7
Excellent product.,iPhone 11
E-MOBILE SELLER IS CHEATING WITH CUSTOMERS GIVES DEFECTIVE IPHONES,iPhone 7
"I have an iPad Air 128GB with sim. Used it extensively & recently it gave problems with my playing PUBG on it. Had little doubt at first buying it online & some reviews were negative. Then I went to buy my iPad’s charger; which had stopped working & other chargers were from Amazon were not upto the mark; form the same seller. Found the iPad Charger genuine; then went for this iPad & iPhone 7 Rose gold 32 GB, for my wife.This seller is genuine & while unboxing and setting it up iPhone 7, everything is perfectly new condition. Needless to say; my wife got both iPad Air (old but in prestine condition) & iPhone 7 almost at the same time.All the devices (three to be exact) I purchased from this seller is genuine & 1,500 ₹ to 1,700 ₹ cheaper than Apple’s store. If you have relatives/friends abroad, there you get it say approx 5,000 ₹ (after currency conversion). Previously the difference used to be 20,000 ₹ during the time iPhone 6 was out. It was worth the wait then.As far as packaging is concerned; Amazon has gone great lengths for delivering such high quality items; securely & promptly.",iPhone 7

"There are many reviews of the iPhone so I wont do that here.I love it (of course, I have been a iPhone user for over 5 years)Special mention: I just love the camera.Two irritants1. Siri is not very good at understanding Indian accent (Google gets it right every time)2. Doing away with the 2.5mm headphone jack does not seem like such a great idea. Maybe they will change their mind with their new products.",iPhone 7

"Using this phone from 2016 dec.Few basic user issues which needs to be addressed by appleA- paid call recording which is commonly free for other usersB- true caller works worst on iPhone, it can recognise a call from USA but it cannot recognise a call from local city which is best in Android.C- common charging &  headphone socket- can’t talk on headphone while charging it, needs 3-4 time charge a day. Life of charging / headphone socket is very short.D- battery backup- goes down 1% per min of usage.",iPhone 7

It's a light weight model. Looks like when we hold hard only it ll break. Also call sound is really very low and asking for return and no response from seller or Amazon. Disliked once the package is opened.. and some contraction sound comes out of it once the button is pressed. This is the 1st mobile I feel like disliking in my life.. not satisfied overall,iPhone 7
It's awesome,iPhone 7
There are many other brands which are giving good phones or u can say better than this phone on paper like one plus lg and many more those are good but there after sales service and brand value is pathetic Apple is known for their after sales serviceLet’s come to the review now I purchased this phone on 21 January 2018 and after 24 days of use I can say that it’s beast man what a wonderful color and what a phone don’t go for one plus 5t or something else just go for this as it has fabulous after sales service and a good brand values else it’s your choice do whatever u want to do,iPhone 7
"iPhone 7 - 32GB BlackPros :- Superfast A10 Processor- Improved Home button (Haptic Feedback)- Excellent Low light camera with Image stabilisation- 32GB Storage from base models- Improved Stereo sound from speakers- Great battery life. Almost lasts for a day with a full charge. Significantly better than the predecessor.- Most importantly, this time it is waterproof.Cons :- I had the iPhone 6S (16GB), I haven't noticed much difference and the aesthetics of the phone just feels the same. Not worth upgrading from an iPhone 6 / 6S.- No headphone jack. Have to insert the adaptor in order to use any external headphones with 3.5mm jack.- Screen quality is the same.Verdict : I feel the phone was overhyped while the phone is a very good buy for new iPhone users or anyone upgrading from 5S and below.",iPhone 7

The phone gets very hot (untouchable) after having a video call in 15-20 minutes... battery life is too short.. I gifted it to my brother on his birthday as he was using an android phone. I was very upset on hearing the review from him. raised a complaint before two days but no action has been taken. Days are running out. Very sad approach by amazon.,iPhone 7
Absolutely loving the product,iPhone 7
"There is no point in reviewing the phone itself since anyone who is actually interested in buying an iPhone would have read its reviews on the more relevant websites.I can talk about my experience of buying iPhone from amazon. The product is 100% original, its Indian iPhone model so don't be concerned about claiming the warranty should you need it.Some negatives:1)Even after paying for same day delivery I got my phone after one day2)Packaging of parcel was not so great(less bubble wrap) eventually damaging my iPhone box corners (apple enthusiasts love the product's box also, trust me)3)I bought it in march end but the phone manufacturing date is Dec-2016, making it 3 months old, this effects the battery to a minor level.Also you have to ensure that the warranty starts when you actually bought the product and not when the product was manufactured, with non-original product this is the first risk.",iPhone 7
"Apple is a Brand, game lovers and heavy net users this brand is not for you don't let it down by using it for games. It's symbol of status and not for you guys.

I am using iphone 7 since last 19 months and i am very much proud of it. Giving my personal reviews about itNo any issues except some minor lags and heat isseues while charging and playing games (as its universal in all phones) Back Camera quality is good in 2018 instead of being and 2016 flagship. Front camera is acceptable.Speaker is top at its markComfortable in handGood standby time but battery drains quickly while playing gamesGood software presentationFrequent updates on security and minor bug fixesYou may require a screen protectorGood call qualityYou cant simultaneously charge the phone and use headphones as it lacks headphone jack.Accurate and fast fingerprint sensor. Lacks face unlocking system.Screen not so clearly visible in sunlight. Sometimes irritable to read fonts due to small screen.You you want an iphone in 2018 or up coming 2019 then i will suggest iphone 7 as it is value for money and has same ie. exactly same functions as of iphone 8 except for wireless charging and AI which are gimmick.Matte black rocks.,iPhone 7
"Charging cable is flimsy. It got damaged after 6 months of use. Folks at the apple store refused to cover it under warrantysaying that we physically damaged the cable - I was disappointed by their answer. On a previous instant the charging adapterhas stopped working and they had replaced it no questions asked. It seems this is a recurring problem after reading a few onlineblogs/reddit forums.Also, lack of 3.5mm port is frustrating especially as the earpods were not given with the phone and had to be bought separately.",iPhone 7
"I have bought this phone 10 days back .Pros:1. UI :I love apple’s user interface.It doesn’t disappoint either2.performance: this is something which one can’t deny that apple phones are beast when it comes to performance. I am a heavy user and I always have 15-20 apps running simultaneously and the phone never hung.3.Improved battery life:The battery life is a huge improvement from iphone 6s.4.Dual speakers make the sound much clear5.camera:it has a 7 mp front camera and 12 mp rare . The quality is crystal clear and this feature for an apple product never disappoints as well6.weight: its light weight and easily portable7. After the update to ios 11 ,the user experience is much better and many new features have been added with the updateCons:1.Battery life should have been better.though i have mentioned it as an improvement over iphone 6s ,still i feel that with this price range the battery life should have been better2.Facing lag while playing high end games while connected to the wifi.though it may be the issue with my wifi but somehow I couldn’t rule it out3.No headphone jack : though apple provides a converter for connecting headphone ,it may be considered as a drawback for some.Overall this product is really great and a worth buy definitely. I feel price range should be reduced and given oneplus 6 in market ,the price should come down below 40K",iPhone 7
"If you're going to buy a new iPhone, this is the one to get – there's a slightly longer battery life, a better camera, fast innards and protection against water. However, many of the changes are slight, and the iPhone 6S, for the lower price, suddenly becomes a very attractive option.FOR:Good low light cameraWater resistantDouble the internal capacityAGAINST:Lacks clear upgradesSame design used for last three phonesBattery life unimpressive",iPhone 7
My iPhone 7 is getting overheat...no response from my Amazon store even after replacement order given....Now replacement date also passed,iPhone 7
"Too good a product by Apple! I've been using Android since 2013. Used stock ROM, custom ROM and what not. The smoothness of iPhone and iOS combined is unparalleled. Butter smooth interface. Brilliant camera. Good stereo speakers - till a limit. ""Hidden Shortcuts in iOS"" - finding one each day - being an ex-Android user. The only drawback which I found in my limited time full usage is that under heavy usage, the battery lasts only till evening 3/4 from 10 AM. This includes access to internet and listening to music on the ear pods most of the time. Addition of GPS and watching videos plus gaming reduces the battery life in half the time. But if you are frugal enough, you may stretch the day.However, it seems like Apple has given it fast charge capability, as every time I plug it into the batter bank, it reaches 50% in no time. But, it takes its sweet time to reach 100%. So, no complaints besides the requirement of a bit more juice in the battery. Having, said all, a very good package.",iPhone 7
I doubt if this phone is Original. Very poor cellular connectivity.My colleagues on the same network are getting good connectivity with other phones.So pathetic that iPhone is this poor at basics. People trying to reach me are often getting 'not reachable' message.-5 is the correct rating for this phone. The phone is very slow. Very poor reception of data signal.There is no consolidated view of the call history in IPHONE. IOS is useless compared to Android.I wish I can tell this to everyone looking to buy an IPHONE.,iPhone 7
"Another genius phone from Apple. Design wise not much of a change but the internals are excellent. My entire family is a big fan of both Amazon and Apple so this just couldn't get any better.

Display problem occurs within 5 months,iPhone 7
"I cross checked its serial number on apple support care and apple support is showing mismatch in its serial number.I have received different Iphone color, its brightness is also very low, seems a fake display is used in it. Front Camera quality is so poor. I have been looted by amazon and its seller. This i phone is not a Genuine!Also Customer care is not supporting in this.No Trust left by this.",iPhone 7
"Why pple go for iPhone 7,8 If iPhone SE(2 Gen) is already there in same size and glass back almost in same price tag with more Specs and much better than 7 & 8 in terms of speed,,,It would be a foolish choice to go for older models.",iPhone 7
The product stoped working from the date return date ended. Never experienced this kind of product from Apple and it’s my second phone from Apple,iPhone 7

There are 2 optionsFor you in this price segment1-One plus 6T2-iphone 7I really don't like androidBcuz of irritating ads in every app and lag.(I was using Nokia 7plus )So I decided not to go with the android this time.At the end of the day it's upto youIf youlike android then you must go with one plus 6tOr the iPhone 7.Got it next day thanks Amazon.,iPhone 7

"I don't understand how few people out here have ended up getting defective pieces. I purchased this phone 3 weeks ago and had been using an iPhone 5s until then and I must say, the delivered product is absolutely legit and genuine. For the sake of my satisfaction I verified it on Apple's website by putting in my iPhone's IMEI number so there's no doubt about the authenticity of the product these people are selling down here.Now mentioning my experience with this phone so far:1) The quality of the iPhone I received is absolutely stunning and the performance is incredibly fast and fluid. I must say that this phone is a beast in terms of performance. In fact you wouldn't even notice any significant performance difference between an iPhone 7 and an iPhone 8 when it comes to day to day tasks.2) The camera is top notch and helps you shoot DSLR level videos and click some crystal clear and crisp photos on this 4.7 inch device. Front facing camera is incredible and the Touch ID sensor is blazing fast in recognising your fingerprint.3) The dual stereo speakers on this iPhone give you a very rich and dynamic music experience. This is coming from an active earphone user.4) I'll say that the display on this iPhone isn't the best when you compare it to the latest Android phones but it's certainly not disappointing at all.5) Battery life I feel is decent and can get you through a day easily if you aren't a very intense user.",iPhone 7

"I've been using iphone 5s, then 6 and now 7. I must say that I'm impressed with the fingerprint, camera quality, and ofc a little with the battery life. The detailed review is as follows:-Camera: Yeah so it has a good camera, (not a camera with today's trending features,) and the best colors in this price. Yes its a competition to the pixel 2 when it comes to colors, ofc pixel 2 offers more features and that's why its better.Battery: Battery is something i must say is improved but still not upto the mark like other android phones. They offer a way better battery and at this price we expect apple to put in some effort to improve the battery life. *7-8 hours with internet on. *2 hours continuous gaming. *12 hours fine/low usage.Performance: Iphone gives you performance like no other phone. Best in performance is what iphones provide. HD display in gaming. Pubg runs smooth as butter and colors are lovely.Fingerprint: It gives a good fingerprint experience. But no face unlocking.",iPhone 7
"Hi this is a very good product under 57,000 also it is a iPhone 7 brand hrx edition I really loved it. Below are some features and brief description about it.BRIEF DESCRIPTION:-For all the iPhone lovers, Apple brings you the best yet. The iPhone 7 improvises on the best features of the previous generations of Apple phones. Be it the camera, the battery or the speakers, the iPhone 7 aces the game. Experience a power packed performance with the iPhone 7. Sporting a stylish compact body, the iPhone 7 is splash proof and water resistant. From a brilliant display to overwhelming sound quality, name it and the iPhone 7 has it all.Strong Water Resistant BodyNow, you can make the most of your pool parties and your outdoor games. Apple engineers have designed the iPhone 7 in such a way that it is water resistant, splash proof and dust proof. So, whether it is raining or you are at a beach, let nothing come in between your photo sessions and fun times.Feel the 3D TouchThe sensitive touchscreen of the iPhone 7 also allows you 3D touch. Also, the new Retina HD display incorporates the 3D touch facility across the iOS. Be it the music, messages or your calendar app, connect with all that in a more responsive manner with the 3D touch. See how the 3D feature works on the screen and feel the difference. The iPhone 7 also includes a home button which is a one-touch button to reach the home screen. This button is designed to be more pressure sensitive and is super responsive. In sync with the taptic engine, the home button responses precisely and is durable for prolonged use.OIS for Better Image QualityIf you love capturing all your special moments, the iPhone 7 cameras will be a delight for you to use. The optical image stabilization technology ensures that your images are free from distortion. Even if your hand shakes while clicking photos or if the subject is in movement, the image stabilization feature makes sure that your photos are crisp and clear. The sensor counters the tiniest of movement and allows up to 3x times longer exposure. The iPhone camera is powered by the image signal processor which makes your photos look perfect despite poor lightening and sudden movements. The image signal processor is built into the a10 fusion chip and powers over 100 billion operations to make your photos and videos look amazing. It also enhances the white balance in the photos and helps the auto focus.Now, even Facetiming is more fun with the iPhone 7.

Let not the size fool you. It not just makes the iPhone work faster, but also ensures that the functions are well executed. The processing speed is higher than the previous iPhones and does not even require much power.

The experience I had in dealing with Amazon doesnt even warrant a single star !It was pathetic.The phone was gifted to someone and it was getting heated up post charging. Amazon couldnt do anything about it and wanted to have the person who got this phone as a gift to call Apple and go through the troubleshooting steps to have this figured out. They were not even willing to having this phone exchanged !Amazon customer service is totally useless !!!,iPhone 7
I am using i phone 7 battery is verry poor around 7 hrs only i chrgd every day 3 4 times pls improve battery backup and the phone was very good camera finger print every thing is good only the prblm is battery battery rating i given out 5 1 only,iPhone 7

"Made a wrong choice buying a BALCK 7 from Paytm. The phone was a defective piece and they harassed a lot for return. Bought from Amazon Silver and I am glad I made the right choice. The deliver was fast, customer care was helpful for delivery, and delivery too was promt. Now to the phone- Awesome phone, very fast in functioning,  love the sleek style of it. On the  whole the experience of buying from Amazon and the phone both were satisfactory. Go for it. No one can beat the IPhone quality and the ""SWAG"" of it. yes u will hear that u will get a  bunch of phones with more specs, but a ""IPhone is a IPhone"", the experience of carrying it will be a great fun and sure will be on a different level.",iPhone 7
The phone is selling for a price greater than it's original price,iPhone 7
"It's a nice product with good battery life, with a single charge it stays a little more than one day on 4G/wi-if.Home key is awesome. Sound quality is very good.Tried with my Bose headphones using the 3.5 mm converter, it was mind blowing.Camera is cool with live. The 12MP is much greater than any other 16MP.Overall a good buy but prices slashed just after my order confirmation. 😊",iPhone 7
This is good product because of its battery life sound quality and ofcourse its camera is too good i hope that i can get this but i dont have enough money to buy but this is good product you can buy this product instead of other smartphone this phone deserve this price but at last i want to say dont think about android just buy ios . And ofcourse apple company is also popular in allaround world,iPhone 7
"Phone gets heated up after watching vedio just for half an hour Seems like duplicate product, Don't buy anything from this seller",iPhone 7
"● There are the different iPhones currently sold in India as on Jul-17- iPhone SE- iPhone 6s- iPhone 6s Plus- iPhone 7- iPhone 7 Plus● There is no point in writing in length about these phones since everyone is very well aware on the reasons why they may shop for an iphone. So, I thought it make sense to compare the prominet features that could help you to make your decision easier** iPhone SE **● This is a 4 inch phone that fits very comfortably into your hands and is good for your wallet since the 16GB version costs around Rs.21,000● This packs the same A9 processor, camera, fingerprint sensor and many other features of iPhone 6S and 6s Plus● The 12mpx camera is one of the best among phones around Rs.20,000. It supports 4K videos, live photos, full HD slow motion video, etc.● In terms of performance also, the phone stands among the top in the list in the Rs.25,000 bracket● If you dont like big screen phones, this is the best phone for you. But I would say if you have used a bigger screen phone, you would definitely struggle with this one since reading stuff on a 4 inch screen will be a real pain for you. In that case, spend this money on an Android phone and you will love it** iPhone 6s **● The main difference 6s has over SE is that 6s has got 3D Touch and display zoom other than a bigger screen of 4.7 inches3D touch is an amazing feature where the phone can understand the pressure you put on screen while touching and can activate various functions like double click, left click or many other functions that could have been achieved by more than one click● 6s also comes with a 128GB option while SE stops at 64GB● 6s has got a larger battery, but there is not much difference in battery endurance due to the bigger display● The selfie camera is also upgraded from 1.2mpx in SE to 5mpx in 6s● So, if you are on a tight budget, but still want to go for an iPhone, this one is the best choice. I bought the 32GB version for Rs.35,888 in Jun-17**iPhone 6s Plus **● The only difference 6s Plus has over 6s is the screen size which is 5.5 inch and optical image stabilisation for main camera● 6s Plus had been infamous for rumours that the phone could bend from the pressures of your pocket, but Apple is reported to have addressed it by using high-grade aluminium● Optical Image Stabilisation works can effectively eliminate effects of camera shake and images are sharper. This is especially useful during low light where the exposre is longer and there are more changes for your hand to shake or shiver during shooting● The larger screen is good for watching videos, reading, etc. And if you are a gamer, spending this much for a 5.5 inch phone makes sense. This is sold at around Rs.45,000 for the 16GB version● The phone performance and battery endurance is very much similar to iphone 6s● If you dont have a need for a larger screen, I would not recommend to spend more money, but iPhone 6s would do good for you. if you are serious on this one, I would suggest to spend a little more and go for iPhone 7** iPhone 7 **● iPhone 7 brings in a low of new features● This comes with a 4.7inch display. The display is one of the best on smartphones with a lot of new features. In practical, the display is brighter, very easy on eyes and colour reproduction is more accurate● The processor is upgraded to A10 and the camera sensor is also upgraded that excels is low light photography. The dual camera system captures depth information● There is no 3.5mm headphone plug, instead it packs the wireless earpods. However, it comes with a 3.5mm adapter that connects to the lightning port● The phone is splash as well as dust resistant● The jet black and red are the new colours iPhone 7 is sold iniPhone 7 is one of the biggest update and comes with a lot of exciting features. The 32GB version is sold at Rs.49,000. If you are serious about iPhone 7, you may need to think spending around Rs.60,000 for the black or red since the phone does not look much different from iPhone 6s if not on these colours** iPhone 7 Plus **● This is only for those people who have got deep pockets. The base version is sold at around Rs.72,000● The phone has got a bigger screen of 5.5 inch and a superior camera with optical zoom & telephoto aperture** Summary **● Go for iPhone SE only if you use your phone mainly to make calls or if you are upgrading from a smaller phone. If you are moving from a bigger screen phone, the 4 inch display of this phone will be a pain for you● iPhone 6s is the phone that I recommend if you dont want to spend too much money, but would like to boast of your iPhone among your mates● 6s Plus is not at all recommended because you will get iPhone 7 with a lot of new features if you spend a little more. However, if your only need is a larger screen I wont stop you● iPhone 7 is in a different league. Its the best iPhone available today according to me● If you are struggling to spend your hard-earned money, put it on iPhone 7 Plus black or red where you will get an amazing  gadget to show off.",iPhone 7

"Absolute agony and mental torture...I have paid a fortune to own this piece of crap phone called iPhone, and the agonising weeks I had after the purchase was not even describable ... I bought the iPhone 7 after years of using the droids. It sure is smooth and fast and all the BS Apple fans boast about, then that is it. I had a list of things going against using the crap which includes:1.) The back camera (main camera) of the phone stopped working in just 2 weeks. No, I didn't dropped it anywhere, and it was protected with a cover every time. I have submitted my phone to the Apple care in Bangalore, and they said it would take them 3 weeks to check what the problem is and if a replacement can be made (of course my phone is under warranty!). On searching the Internet, the main camera blackout issue was a common problem in iPhone 7. Wow!!!2.) The space in the phone was never enough. Even though it has 32 GB, it got filled up in a jiffy. I backed up my videos and photos in the cloud, and still it gets filled up too soon.3.) The App and System updates were a pain  - each iOS update is no less than 1 GB to download and so is the Apps from the App store. Common apps like Whatsapp and Evernote runs in hundreds of MBs each time there's an update. My Internet data ends up updating them like in a week max.4.) Simple operations like downloading a song directly from Internet WAS NOT POSSIBLE - Even with a browser like Chrome. I then came to know that iOS prohibits downloading anything from Internet in their iPhones. To transfer files, you have to connect the phone to your system, open up the utter nonsensical iTunes and transfer the files.5.) Even though I knew there's no 3.5 mm headphone jack to it, It really was a pain when I started using it. I either can charge it or listen to the music, but not both. Why Apple why?6.) The accessories are too costly. I wanted the wireless  earpods which comes with the iPhone versions after 7, and look at its price.... I am never gonna pay that for a wireless earpod. If I have that much money, why shouldn't I go for a premium wireless headphone like the Bose?7.) The battery died off too soon. My phone was not even keeping its charge for more than 10 hours a day!I don't know on what plans I had purchased this phone. I am definitely going back to the droids.",iPhone 7

"The phone seems to be heavily discounted here.. Isn't that an indication that there's something fishy..these iphones are refurbished sold as brand new..they are pretty used hence they are sold at such a discounted price...if you don't believe me, go through the one star reviews and see.. They'll be many complains as regards the box being opened or the documentation being missing",iPhone 7

"Its been one week using my iphone7 from using new ios11 software , its only 7 days and i am really fed up😩 ! Sources have stated that apple is slowing down the speed of ios 5,6,7 under the new software update (ios11), and its not a rumuor !WHATS NEW :HANGS : WHEN ios 11.0.0 came , iphone6 was hanging more than androids😱 , after 11.0.1 sudden closedowns stopped , but still hangs !After 11.0.2 , its a little better !BATTERY : As we know , its about 1600 mah , but battery used by software also matters , and u should know that ios11 uses more than two times battery in background than ios10About 15% battery gets lost 😱in one hour (15 minutes screen on only )I HAVE ATTACHED PICS FOR SAME !SMART CONTROL CENTRE : its the first time that u can turn on/off mobile data without going to setting , also a whole new control centre is here , i loved😍 it (pic attached -screenshot)Finally , i will like to say that i am fed up with my phone (main reason battery )",iPhone 7

"I phone removed the 3.5 mm headphone jack to receive money from third party manufacturers which makes any product or thing that uses the lightning port of apple. Eg headphones , otg cables, car audio connection cables etc. With out paying apple a percentage of the commission apple won't allow to make accessories for its lightning port. We can't use any  normal headphone or electronics in this stupid iPhone. All accessories cost 4 times its normal cost. So you have to suffer. A accessory manufacturing company paid a fine of more than 1 crore for manufacturing products for the lightning port without permission. So beware only less accessories will be there.",iPhone 7

"I'm writing this review after using the iPhone 7 for about a week, here are the things that I liked, disliked and thought are worth to mention.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------WHATS IN THE BOX-==================1. THE IPHONE 7 ITSELF2. THE LIGHTNING EARPODS3. LIGHTNING TO 3.5 MM JACK CONVERTOR4. LIGHTNING TO USB CABLE5. POWER ADAPTER6. SIM EJECTOR PIN--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE DESIGN-=============So the new iPhone 7 black variant has a nice aluminum body with matte finish. the iPhone 7 is also now waterproof with IP67 rating. the 12mp rear camera with the led flash are present on the back, the power button with the I'm tray are present on the right side, the volume rockers and the profile button are located on the left side, on the front we have the 7mp f2.2 camera, ear piece, sensors and the 4.7 inch 1334x750-pixel resolution at 326 ppi display and the home button are present, now the home button is not really a button, it has what apple calls the taptic engine which gives a haptic feedback and simulated a real button, but doesn't really feels like a button, you can select the type of haptic feedback you like form three options. the home button also has the fingerprint scanner or touch id, its a nice quick and accurate scanner. the 4.7 inch display great too. with great viewing angles, vibrancy, and color reproduction. the colors looks natural and with nice saturation and contrast. expected nothing less from apple on this. now the biggest down side of this phone is the removal of the headphone, apple says that the lightning connector works great as an audio source for headphones, but I still miss my the 3.5mm jack, apple did provide a small lightning to 3.5mm adapter which is something you also need to carry around if you want to listen from your normal headphones or you have to switch to Bluetooth audio.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE CAMERA-=============the camera has a good improvement from the iPhone 6s, it doesn't have dual cameras like the iPhone 7 plus, but it performs great. the are very detailed with great color reproduction, contrast level. the images are vibrant with good amount of saturation and sharpness. the 12mp camera now also have optical image stabilization so the video are nice and stabilized as the iPhone 6s it also shoots in 4k, the front facing 7mp camera has been improved a lot, its has nice wide frame and the image quality is also very natural, the video quality of the front facing camera is also nice you have to be careful with lighting or otherwise the contrast levels sometimes gets messed up.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE PERFORMENCE-======================the iPhone 7 has the apple A10 fusion chips with six core graphics and 2gb of ram, the new processor performs great, it easily handles heavy usage and gaming, multitasking is also very fluid, it easily handles tons of app running in the background simultaneously with just 2gb of ram. the iPhone 7 comes with the new iOS 10 which has great features like the new version of siri and improved 3d touch. if you are a moderate user it will work flawlessly for you. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE BATTERY-================the iPhone 7 only have a 1960 mah battery, but don't let that small size fool you it easily lasts a day even under heavy usage you can easily get it to work till night. another down side of this phone is that it doesn't support fast charging, it takes around 2 hours to fully charge from 10% to 100%. but you can also use an ipad charger to make the charging speed a little bit faster.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- THE PROS AND CONS--THE PROS-==========1. GREAT BUILD QUALITY2. WATERPROOF3. GREAT CAMERA4. GREAT DISPLAY5. FINGERPRINT SCANNER6. GREAT FOR GAMING7. GREAT FOR MULTITASKING8. STEREO SPEAKERS-THE CONS-============1. NO HEADPHONE JACK2. NO FAST CHARGING-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------FINAL VERDICT- The iPhone is a great flagship smartphone with great specs, performance and camera, it might not be that much worth to upgrade from an iPhone 6 or 6s but if you want the better camera, waterproofing you can definitely go for it.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[...]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------THANK YOU",iPhone 7

everything is perfect but the speakers make a lot of unneccessary noise,iPhone 7
"The phone is nice in the things it claims to be nice in..Like the camera is very good. Takes amazing pictures in day as well as low lighting situations.The speakers are the best I've heard on a smartphone, I had the Htc m9+ and these are better than those speakers..it has a beautiful screen. It's small n light weight..But this version of iPhone has the most bugs ever I think..it's wifi drops signal every few minutes. It just won't recognise your network. It'll show your network in other networks but won't connect to it.! Now the primary reason why we buy phones these days 'smartphones' not just any phones is for internet n connection.. if one can't do that than what's the point of spending so much.Even mobile signal drops randomly.It does lag in some animations. And some apps are not properly optimised so it lags in those apps.The thing now is I asked amazon for a replacement for this piece since it had several connections issues but Amazon now wants a receipt from Apple, a job sheet to replace the phone. I have to travel so far to an Apple Store now to get this thing done. Not like the Amazon I knew before.Also the delivery by amazon was so slow, it took almost a week after the product was dispatched to reach me.All I would say is the phone is nice, but when you look at it, it's not worth the 49k after hdfc cash back also forget 60k.. It loooks and performs average. No longer can we say it's Apple, it just works. There are no problems in Apple in whatever limited freedom we get to customise it.. It's just like android now.. Same problems.. N I think even more than android when am paying so much for it..",iPhone 7

I tried to return the product but was refused .I went to apple store and they after discussing for 3 hours said they cannot do anything , amazon is not even a offical reseller and they give light quality products . After spending hours with customer care executives on apple and amazon , I had to keep this pathetic handset .",iPhone 7

"I’ve been using this device from past 6 months, the thing is I’m not so much impressed by it.- Iphone is way too restrictive(you cannot literally download anything outside App store)- Multitasking is not there (Even nowadays a cheaper android phone provides multi window)- Display & Resolution (1334x750 are we in 2013 ? , and LCD Panel i mean seriously on 50k phone -.-)- ios 11 (Havoc, Nothing New , worst)- For all the people who are in love with their so called iPhones -.- ‘IPhones hangs too , they are not perfectly fluid, and Touch ID is not the fastest.- Camera performance is not that great , look for GPixel / Oneplus  / Samsung/ LG they’re offering much better camera.- Price (Way too high for such average gadget)Advice: Got get a Oneplus flagship- bang for buget or If you need a great camera go for GPixel or samsung flagshipI felt like I’ve thrown my money in gutter and also feel regret of my decision by buying this device.I hope you agree !",iPhone 7
"If you have used iphone 6 then u'll not feel a difference in case of size. But the feel will be very different. There ain't a physical button here in iphone 7 so be careful. The cameras are upgraded and the matte black shade is amazing. But if you are a girl and you've bought the black one, you might regret at first (trust me i wanted the rose gold one). Overal its a great phone. But do mind one thing, this phone is hella slippery! Make sure to use a phone cover",iPhone 7

this is wrong details mentionedthis phone only gsm not cdma,iPhone 7
"Build and Design: 8/10The iPhone 7 Plus does not come with a drastically new design. You can look at it more of adding finesse to the iPhone 6 Plus and iPhone 6s Plus designs. The similar design is now in its third generation. Is Apple holding out till next year, to release a brand new design language? Not that it is bad in the current state, but it dosen’t make it stand out from its predecessors. Not to mention, the designs from its Android arch-rivals has certainly seen changes over the years.The first thing that you will notice when you handle the phone, is that the visible antenna lines have been nicely camouflaged. While it is still visible to an extent on the Rose Gold, Silver and Gold variants of the phone; on the Matte Black and Jet Black versions, you have to really look for it.The rounded edges, power / standby, volume rocker buttons and the ringer notch are all in the same spot as the iPhone 6s Plus. So is the home button. But there’s a catch. The circular button isn’t a push button anymore but is supported by the Taptic Engine’s feedback mechanism. The Taptic Engine which supports the 3D touch mechanism for the display, also controls the touch response on the button. You can set the levels of feedback for the button, and honestly after a while you forget that the button isn’t there. It is one cool implementation. And it is such fine design details that make Apple products what they are.The edges are 7.3mm thick and it weighs around 188 grams. While the thickness is the same as its predecessor, it is around 4 grams lighter. In terms of overall feel of the phone and sturdiness, there isn’t much different from the iPhone 6s Plus. And the complaint we had with the 6s Plus remains. The iPhone 7 Plus offers a terrible body to screen ratio as compared to some of its Android flagships such as the Galaxy S7 edge or the newly launched Google Pixel XL, which offers 5.5-inch display in a more compact body.The rear side has a bump in the top left hand corner which houses two 12MP camera sensors. Snapping on cover on the iPhone brings the camera bump with the plane of the iPhone back.There is one important addition though. It is IP67 certified which makes it water and dust resistant.Metal back is still as slippery as its predecessors. Apple has some really cool leather covers with metallic button areas if you have buttery hands. They sell separately, of course. Snapping them on further reduces ease of one-handed use. And no, you cannot use the last generation covers on this phone for obvious reasons. I got the matte black variant to review, and it looks quite wonderful, as compared to the other three colours. The Jet Black variant is still the more premium variant, and I would not be surprised if we see more Jet black or piano black phone colours over the coming months.Features: 8.5/10Thanks to a limited product portfolio in its smartphone segment, Apple really ensures that the internals get a good amount of upgrade in the coming generations. To that extent, the iPhone 7 Plus comes with the Apple A10 Fusion chipset which has a quad-core processor clocked at 2.23GHz. This is paired with 3GB RAM. It comes with a 5.5-inch Full HD resolution display.There are three storage variants – 32GB, 128GB and 256GB of which we have the 256GB variant for review. There is no expandable storage.It runs on iOS 10. A single nano SIM card slot is present on the right hand side, just below the power/standby button. It supports dual band Wi-Fi 802.11 ac, Wi-fi hotspot, Bluetooth 4.2, GPS with A-GPS and GLONASS, NFC only for Apply Pay which is not available in India. And also, no FM radio.The big changes on the features front is the dropping of the 3.5mm audio jack. You will need a lightning port connector on your earphones. Apple bundles a pair. Other option is using a Bluetooth headset to enjoy your music. Apple has also bundled in a lightning port to 3.5 mm audio jack adapter for those who still want to rely on their personal audio gear. This is one move that drew a lot of flak as a lot of us still prefer using personal earphones / headphones which still have a 3.5mm jack. But give it some time and you will see a lot more lightning port earphone accessories, going by Apple’s history of spawning off accessories market segments. The iPhone 7 Plus comes with stereo speakers finally, with one being at the base and the other on the earpiece speaker.On the camera front, you get two 12MP sensors on the back and there is a 7MP front-facing FaceTime HD camera. Apple has implemented the dual rear cameras in a way that you get to use true 2x optical zoom.Display: 8/10The iPhone 7 Plus sports a 5.5inch FullHD display which gives a pixel density of 401PPI. The panel is an LED backlit IPS LCD panel. However with the iPhone 7 Plus, Apple claims to be using a wide gamut display (cinema standard). When placed side by side with the iPhone 6s/6s Plus, I noticed that the iPhone 7 Plus had a slight warm tinge to it. The iPhone 7 Plus is definitely a notch brighter than the 6s Plus. The Night Shift mode lets you select the time when you want to display to control the blue light, and it also lets you select the shade of yellow that you are comfortable with. This added granularity is a nice touch.Colour reproduction is spot on and it is still a class-leading display among smartphones. Colours aren’t unnecessarily vivid. Legibility in sunlight is not an issue, as its auto-brightness mode works quite well. The display, as has been the case with previous generations, is quite glossy. It was while shooting in bright sunlight where at times all I could see on the display was my reflection, specially when shooting from chest height. Not so much at the eye level.The black levels on the display are quite good and watching movies or playing games is a lot of fun. Games such as Vain Glory, Real Racing 3, Nova 3 look gorgeous on this calibrated display.Software: 8/10Apple iPhone 7 Plus comes with the latest iOS 10 operating system. The one running on the review unit was 10.0.3 on which majority of the testing was done, before switching to the 10.1 beta to access the Portrait mode in the Camera app. The iOS 10 is refined and operationally quite smooth on most occasions. There were a few instances of apps not registering action on first tap.iOS 10 dosen’t look very different from its predecessor, but packs in a lot of new features. For starters, you can now uninstall the native Apple apps if you don’t need them. I figured I would do without Stocks, Home and a couple of other apps which I deleted. Technically it just hides the icon and deletes all the app data from your phone. You can reinstall the app by searching for it in the App store.The 3D touch still offers the Peek and Pop features, with support added to a lot more apps than we had seen when the 6s Plus launched.Messages has got a complete revamp with the app letting you add in GIF animations; finger gestures –  creating animations such as heart break, beating heart and more; send photos from the camera while in the app; share music and so on. While these additions are playing catch up to the likes of apps such as Telegram, it makes little sense to use Messages if your family or friend circle isn’t on Apple devices.Control Centre has been modified, with the music control shifted to a new tab. Also the four icons at the base – torch, timer, calculator and camera support 3D gestures, letting you access more functions without leaving the Control Centre screen. iOS 10 also lets you do a lot from the lock screen itself. You can swipe left to open the camera or swipe right to access widgets or swipe from the top to bottom to see notifications. There’s also the ‘Raise to Wake up’ feature which wakes up the display when you just lift your iPhone to your face if its lying in the sleep mode on your desk.Music app has got some design changes. Instead of My Music, you now get a Library tab which lets you enlist a variety of options from Playlists, Artists, Album, Songs and so on. You can download songs if you are a subscriber, optimise storage by setting a limit on auto downloads, auto-generated playlists in the ‘For You’ section and more.The Photos app has got some additions in the form of Memories, where in iOS makes albums based on your photos shot at a particular location. In short, this is Apple Photos playing catch up to Google Photos, which has much more interesting features.Siri was the star feature of the iPhones when it was first announced back in 2011. Since then Google has been getting better with its AI-backed virtual assistant game – first Google Now and this year the Google Assistant. Between the two, we noticed that the Assistant was able to understand accents better and let you have contextual conversations, whereas with Siri you still have to pay attention to your diction.Even asking Siri simple questions such as “what was the iPhone 7 Plus pricing for India” or “when was Siri released?” the responses weren’t very forth coming. Also between the two I also realised that most of the times you have to ask Siri questions in a particular way, and you cannot ask follow up questions and get satisfactory responses as you do with Assistant. Apple says Siri is a self-learning system, so maybe it needs more usage. But after using it for a week, it isn’t significantly better than Google Assistant. One thing I would grant Siri is the way it presents card information – is much more richer and informative than Google.Performance: 9/10Call quality is top notch with audible earpiece speaker even in high traffic situations. The iPhone 7 Plus supports Cat 9 LTE, voice over LTE, Wi-fi calling. I did not find any connectivity issues with a Jio SIM card on it, and was able to make successful VoLTE calls.With the latest Apple A10 Fusion chipset paired with 3GB of RAM (the highest seen on an Apple iPhone) you get a wicked fast device. The A10 Fusion chipset houses a quad-core processor, with two high power cores clocked at 2.23GHz and two low power saving ones. There’s a six-core GPU as well. The single core performance score of 3445 observed on GeekBench 4 was the highest we have seen on any smartphone we have tested so far. Even the multi-core score is only second to Huawei P9. The AnTuTu benchmark gives 186093 – again the highest score.In terms of raw numbers, the iPhone 7 Plus comes out tops. In real life usage though, the phone runs lag free and things such as app switching, finger print scanning work fast. The phone does get warm when you are on a particularly photography heavy day, but never crossing 36-38 degree mark on the Fluke IR thermometer.Gaming on the phone is smooth. No frame drops were observed on high end games such Vain Glory, Nova 3, Real Racing 3 and so on. Watching movies with the stereo speakers is quite a fine experience. The speakers are quite loud, but in certain applications such as YouTube, we observed that using the headphones was a battery option.Camera: 8.5/10One of the highlight feature of the iPhone 7 Plus is the presence of the dual rear camera setup. Sure, this isn’t the first time we are seeing a dual camera on a smartphone. Huawei and LG have done this before. But just like all things Apple, the implementation is different. There are two 12MP sensors, one is standard camera which has an equivalent focal length of 28mm (with an f/1.8 aperture) and the other sensor has a telephoto lens having a 56mm focal length (with an f/2.8 aperture). The standard 28mm lens comes with OIS, whereas the telephoto lens does not. This implementation lets the iPhone 7 Plus offer true 2x optical zoom. The Camera app lets you easily switch regular wide angle shot and the 2x optical zoom shot. This ensures that there is no loss in detail when taking 2x zoom photos.While it may seem like they are two different cameras, they do tend to work together everytime you fire off the shutter. You can use these two lenses when shooting videos as well, but switching to the 2x zoom, will remove the OIS feature. The two lenses work quite well in the Portrait mode which is currently available on the iOS 10.1 beta. Also another thing to note is that the telephoto lens can only be used in well lit situations, and if the light isn’t enough, the iPhone 7 Plus will use the regular lens with 2x digital zoom. Apple’s image processor takes this decision on the fly.The iPhone 7 Plus has a 7MP front facing FaceTime HD camera and quad LED flash unit on the rear side. Features carried forward from the iPhone 6s Plus include the live photos, phase detect autofocus. The Camera app is also similar to the one seen in the last generation.Coming to the image quality, the iPhone 7 Plus just like its predecessors, delivers. Colours come out natural and at times it may look a bit too dull when compared with images coming out of say a Samsung Galaxy S7 edge or even the latest Google Pixel XL. Apple iPhone 7 Plus gives a neutral output, with good amount of detail, great dynamic range. Optical zoom works quite well in bright outdoors. You also get the option of using 10x digital zoom for still images and 6x digital zoom for video. Use this only in emergency situations as there is a lot of artifacts you will get in the final images. When forcing the HDR mode, we also noticed some artifacts around the edges if the subject moved too much, as is seen in the fur of the labrador in the image below, around the right paw.Panoramas come out really good, and there is good exposure control. You can also get HDR Panorama shots with the new camera app. There were instances when shooting panoramas in bright sunlight, where I noticed mild change in the sky exposure. But the image stitching is relatively better than that seen on Android phones. The 2x optical zoom also offers Panorama mode.Focussing is relatively quick. But time to first shot is still slow as compared to the quicker ways in which you can turn on cameras in some Android phones. Double tapping the home button to launch the camera is really a no brainer which Apple should implement.Low light image quality is good, but in a side by side comparison with the Google Pixel XL, I noticed that the Pixel XL clearly took the lead there. I’m not saying iPhone 7 Plus is a bad camera in low light – far from it. But the noise control, detail retention, dynamic range seen on the Galaxy S7 and Pixel XL is notches above the iPhone 7 Plus.The Portrait mode was one area which Apple spoke about a lot during the launch. During the time of testing it was only available on the beta, though it is now available to everyone. Once you turn on the Portrait mode, you will get instructions below the rounded square frame, whether you need to move closer or farther. Once you get the lock, the focussing frame becomes yellow and you fire the shutter. Images clicked in the portrait mode turned out good, it works specially well when you are in a well lit area and there is respectable distance between the subject and the background. The blurring of the background is nicely done and isn’t as aggressive as what we have seen with other dual camera phones. The good thing is that you can see the shallow depth of field while you are composing the shot. But the problem is that it will take some practise to get the shot faster. Your subject will have to really be patient till you get everything right. This may be cool when shooting friends and family, but if you are on the street and want to get that quick portrait with a defocussed background, then that can prove difficult.On the video front, the iPhone 7 Plus can shoot up to 4K resolution videos. The OIS on the phone ensures that there is minimal camera shake, although you do see a slight jello effect when walking and shooting. The camera region does get warm when shooting videos. But not enough to cause it to shut down, as I have observed with Sony flagship smartphones.Battery Life: 8/10Coming with a 2900mAh non-removable battery, the iPhone 7 Plus has seen a bump in this department as compared to the previous generation. In a word, the battery life is excellent. There wasn’t a day in the two weeks that I was using the phone, when I found the battery to be draining out before my work day. In fact, with a 100 percent charge at 8AM, and after a day of regular usage, I would still have around 20 percent charge remaining till around 10PM. Heavy usage including playing games, streaming video, calling, messaging via multiple apps, using the camera extensively did drain out the battery by around 9PM. The battery usage numbers show some really good numbers with a 16 hour plus usage time and standby time of over 40 hours. It also offers the Low Power mode, which further extends the battery.Charging seems to take forever though. It easily takes over 3 hours to go from sub-10 percent to 100 percent charge. In an age of rapid charging technologies available on all Android flagships, where you can go from 0 to 100 in just over an hour’s time, Apple’s charging technology seems dated. The good thing is that the iPhone 7 Plus can hold the charge for that much longer vis-a-vis an Android phone. But it’s about time Apple get some sort of quick charging onboard. Is it holding that out for the 10th anniversary edition?Verdict and Price in IndiaAll things considered, the Apple iPhone 7 Plus is a great device. It excels in departments such as battery life, performance, display among other things. The iOS 10 also brings a lot of new features to the table. The implementation of the dual rear camera is quite intelligent. Also portrait mode will be quite loved by those who love that kind of photography – it will just require patience though. While the camera image quality is good, the Apple iPhone 7 Plus still leaves scope for improvement in the low light photography department as we observed in out Pixel XL vs iPhone 7 Plus shootout.If you are on the iPhone 6/6 Plus and are looking for an upgrade, the iPhone 7/7 Plus could be considered. For the 6s / 6s Plus users, there is little to no reason for upgrade. You would rather wait out this iteration for the 10th year iPhone edition.While the iPhone 7 Plus is good, it looks like Apple is leaving the better things for its 10th year edition. Things such as similar design, no quick charging support, similar camera app (which still makes you dig into the General settings to make tweaks in resolution and the like) among other areas have been carried forward from previous two generations. There’s a high possibility that some of these issues would hopefully be addressed in the next gen iPhone.Prices start from Rs 72,000 for 32GB, Rs 82,000 for 128GB and Rs 92,000 for the 256GB variant of the iPhone 7 Plus. The prices are high, and yes you can get a lot more in that amount. But if you want to invest in an iPhone, this is what you have to pay. A lot of telcos are offering the iPhone 7/7 Plus with various data packs as compared to Android competition. Thankfully, the pricing is in line with what it was last year. If 5.5-inch is too large a size for you, then opt for the iPhone 7 which still retains most of the internal features seen on the iPhone 7 Plus.If you are still not convinced about the iPhone 7 Plus, or are short on budget, the Android flagships that you can consider include the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge which is still a powerful device. I have been testing the Google Pixel XL for some days now, and it has already shown its capability in the low light department as compared to the iPhone 7 Plus. So that could also be a possible contender.",iPhone 7

"I wish the iPhone 7 Plus weren't quite so massive in my hands, but otherwise, I love it. The Jet Black iPhone is the first I've used caseless in years, and it's a little bit exhilarating. Thanks to the stickier finish, I haven't dropped it yet (though I suppose there's still time, knock on wood), and it feels a million times better in my hand than the iPhone 6s Plus.Also, the secret unsung hero of the new-old design: water resistance. I ended up accidentally walking into a torrential rainstorm over the weekend with my iPhone in hand, and initially let out an expletive — followed by the realization that I didn't have to worry about my electronics shorting. It's a welcome development.",iPhone 7

"Update: After following the sheep race of having Brand (Oh sorry the Logo)Probably the worst Hyped Phone Brand.Cons-1.) You cant connect to your Pc/Laptop and view its content (any file) directly you require Itunes which requires sync all the time - Even for adding one song it will sync the entire library to sync, absolutely rubbish, technology should be friendly not time consuming.2) Even if you transfer photos from Pc/Laptop to iphone it cant be deleted through your phone, it needs to be deleted from your pc and then synced (Just think about the stupidity-belive it or not try it yourself). Phone storage becomes an issue. You even cant think of transferring through 2 itunes eg: in work area you have laptop and home is another- it wont sync , it will only accpet one itunes - for the other one you need to replace the data & sync again. (Dumbness)3) Battery - Should be given negative, it says its optimized but again personal Experience - if you are just reading or viewing daily news content for just 10-15mins by that itself you will loose power, it will indicate it 100% & as it goes idle it will show 20% decrease ( Thinking i have a faulty device - Try, buy then understand and regret it).There are better products to choose from , cheaper ones are 100 times more better",iPhone 7

I was planning to buy iphone 7 gold but after readind the review i wont make this mistake😏,iPhone 7
Not up the mark... DisappointedAfter spending this much money I HV too face several issues.One should buy I phone from apple store only.,iPhone 7
"GOOD:+ water resistant - this is a huge improvement for me!+increased speed is noticeable w Siri.+the capacity is amazing! I can keep movies, videos, books, photos, music etc without having to store on iCloud or the like (which usually involves a monthly fee).+ decent size (same as iPhone 6S) while remaining portable and although not as big as the 7 Plus, it can still fit in pocket.+Widget feature (swiping to right at home screen) has been improved and now allows editing. You can add or delete features which can be key for privacy and being able to customize is always a good thing.+has lots of added fun features in iMessage (not sure if its the updated software or strictly iPhone 7) like memes, automatic replies and being able to write w your fingertip.+camera takes much better pics (increased the megapixels and the difference is noticeable) and it has 5X zoom capability.+has the fingerprint option for quicker access after you enter your 6 digit pass code to begin.+even slimmer than the iPhone 6 but still able to stand up against something for convenient viewing.+speaker upgrade as it now provides stereo (not up to audiophile standards but still).BAD:- no headphone jack!! but box includes dongle (see photo) which inserts into charging port and provides headphone jack - I have a bet with myself on how long it will take to lose. I know wireless headphones are the future but happy with my old faithful headphones.-the home button is not as well defined. Its gonna take longer than 24 hrs to get used to as it takes me a few tries to activate the home button. It requires the right amount of pressure and despite offering three different options, not easy. The guys at the Apple Store need to stop showing off - on the bright side, I'm thinking it's a learning curve thing and continued use should take care of this issue.",iPhone 7

"I bought I phone 7 from Reliance Digital and I must say I am very disappointed with the product and its after sales service as the phone has some serious heating issues specially if you are multitasking, such as charging and connecting to hotspot at the same time.I bought this issue to Apple care and Reliance Digital guys notice, but no body is accepting that it is an issue after keeping my phone with them for more then a month. Even there are lags while operating the phone. After investing almost 60 K if this is the kind of experience you get out of your purchase its very sad and sickening. Looks like I phone 7 got some issues but manufacturers are trying to hide to keep their success story running. DO NOT GO FOR IT.",iPhone 7

"Apple iPhone 7 (Black, 32GB)

   Very little new changes has been added to it compared to the iPhone 6 series. The iPhone 7 is water proof and the battery capacity has been increased to 1960 mAh from 1715 mAh in iPhone 6S, which gives improved charging capability of up to 2 hours. The display remain the same with Apple’s old IPS LCD Technology since it’s  not a AMOLED screen yet so ghosting can still be issues while running some fast animations. Camera of iPhone 7 has been bumped up to 12 megapixel of primary camera and 7 megapixel of secondary camera for selfies. Also the audio jack of the both 7 and 7 Plus has been removed and only lightning port connection is there. However if you opt for apple's own air pods then it gives much better audio experience than the iPhone 6 itself because it is wireless and communicate seamlessly with Apple’s Virtual Assistant Siri for audio control. Air pods also comes in its charging case with also enables it to pair with Bluetooth devices. The thickness and other dimensions of the phone are same as that of previous 6S but now it feels more comfortable in hands. The Home button has also changed to solid state button which gives quiet good surficial control. iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus comes in limited color that is Jet Black, Silver and Rose Gold.Some of the pros and cons of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are as follows.Pros of the Device is• It has water proof body That the previous iPhone version didn’t had• Enhanced Camera Megapixels with Optical Image Stabilization. For Better Quality Photos and Videos• Increased Battery Capacity. That enables to charge battery faster and also use for longer time.Now Cons of iPhone 7 is• No microSD slot is provided for memory expansion• Its own USB Connector is present.That is lightning cable is used for both charging and audio• Primary Camera is slightly bulged out.Giving a slightly more project at camera than previous 6S So keeping all this mind iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus is certainly the premium end smartphones for this price and as it always had been. But the price is not that much high and in fact same as that of iPhone 6S and there are new innovative changes also added. So iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus is definitely the smartphones to go for and existing iPhone users can also upgrade their smartphones as new iPhone 7 is offering new end features with very little extra cost.To watch the review video of this product visit my profile page, check the from the YouTube channel link and enter the product name in the channel page search icon to get the product review video.",iPhone 7
Excellent!! Best phone ever,iPhone 7
Original product Nahi,iPhone 7
"You may think the iPhone 7 is 3-4 years and old and not worth it. But for this price of Rs 25000 you can't go wrong as there are a bunch of features that Apple gives you that shall make you appreciate this phone. Lets talk of them one by one.a) Build Quality - Clean, timeless, good looking, stable to holdb) Screen - Good resolution for most apps and videos.c) iOS - Functions smoothly. You will however see a hit in the battery.d) Battery - Though its not as good as the bigger phones, expect 4 hours screen on time on average with good standby time.Overall - when the iPhone 7 came out it cost about 60,000 in the market so a few years later you are getting a phone that used to be of that value in just 25,000...this is a good primary phone and a great secondary phone. If this is your first apple, please get it!touchid is reliable, cameras are clean and sharp, excellent support with existing macbook users and good multimedia experience makes this a safe, reliable, not expensive bet.",iPhone 7

You will never outdated for at least couple of years.There is Generally two category of people those who like phone and other one is who like Iphone.This is one of flagship phone by Apple. It was launched in Last Year September and still one of the greatest phone every made by Apple.It is not like I am praising Apple here. But here I am talking about commitment of Apple towards its Customer. Apple is the one the customer who set trends for other companies. For eg. TouchId was introduced by Apple and other phone follows the same. Later on it introduced dual camera mechanism and now a days even range phones having dual camera setup.I am waiting for Iphone 8 and let see now this time what Apple will do.

"NOTE:  This review is addressed to that class of people for whom Rs.60000-70000 smartphone is once in five years thing.Before you judge the rating which I have given and draw conclusions, I just want to let people who read this review realize that I am after technology with some innovation and out of the box concept as I never use a smartphone beyond 12 months.  In this process, I literally used every high-end smartphone that was launched after iPhone 3G (my first hold of a smartphone), be it xperia, blackberry, samsung, nexus, HTC, what not!Now, coming to the point of fake ratings.  I am a bit surprised to see so many negative reviews for an iPhone 7 on Amazon.  KINDLY SEE FLIPKART, without the product even launched on their site, there are 864 ratings and as much as 4.9 stars out of 5 and not a single review (I am enclosing a pic for your reference).  So, there is something which doesn't catch our eye.  But these are the lame tricks that get played when you go neck to neck in competition, it applies to either side.ABOUT APPLEUndoubtedly, I give huge credit to Apple for introducing smartphone concept and in the process they slowly killed the once mighty Blackberry.  Like Thomas Edison, credit goes to Apple for inventing such a masterpiece.  But we are still not using the same bulb which Edison has invented.  There are so many companies which are reinventing bulbs every year.  Apple followed it up for few years with some changes in iPhone to keep the customer base solid.  There is so much hype created over every Apple launch and in the process, the adversaries tried to copy the launch styles of Apple.  So, they clearly have the margin.  But, they are surely lagging behind in terms of innovation.  This year iPhone 7 is one that's a perfect example.COMING TO THE PHONEWatched the launch event so closely, like I always do every year.  I was using an iPhone 6 and was waiting for 7 (I have had an occasion to handle and experience both iPhone 7 and 7 plus even before they were launched in India).  And finally ended up with Galaxy S7 Edge for a reason (BEFORE COMMENTING, RE-READ WHAT I HAVE WRITTEN IN THE FIRST TWO PARAGRAPHS OF MY REVIEW).  I opted for S7 Edge for its curvy screen design with brilliant colours and the camera which beats the iPhone  The dual camera on iPhone 7 plus is not new to the world before its launch.  Secondly, they have their eyes set for the 10th Annniversary of iPhone in 2017 and are holding their cards till then.  Both iOS and Android have their own pros and cons.  This is the area which I am carefully and deliberately side lining and focusing on the phone.This year launch of iPhone 7 is only for those geeks, unlike me, who actually stick to iPhone for life and for whom the price tag is just a symbol to flaunt.  Honestly, as most of the Apple users agree, what matters is the design of the phone.  If i see a person standing about 5 feet away from me with an iPhone 7 (not plus) and me holding my iPhone 6, a third person will obviously think we are using the same phone (not talking about brand).  So, if I were to shell Rs.60000 for a phone which retains the same design crafted with precision for three straight years, I better buy a device which satisfies me with its looks and performs as closely as an iPhone but loses the battle.  And with Rs.20000 cheaper.  I put my chips in there.  Unless you have to run tasks which need some significant power like Games, it's not worth an upgrade or a first time buy.lI would request people to just think a bit before investing your hard earned money to go for iPhone 7.  Join the line in which I am standing for the ""revolutionary"" design of an iPhone 8 in 2017.  Because, that's when Apple is gonna show again to the world that they are masters of innovation.All the best!",iPhone 7

It's good but sometimes some phone calls are missing......,iPhone 7
"Sure, Apple's new iPhone 7 and iPhone7 Plus are amazing. They're fast. They have cool new cameras. They're available in a sleek jet black finish. And they're even water-resistant, so you can play Pokémon GO in the rain. But they're not perfect, so before you shell out $650 or more for a new phone, be sure to consider some of the things that aren't quite perfect about Apple's latest models.1) No headphone jack. We knew this was coming, but it still comes as something of a shock. The venerable headphone jack is gone. Apple is including both a set of earbuds that work with the iPhone 7's Lightning port, as well as a dongle that will let you connect your existing headphones to the phone, but the company really wants you to switch to wireless headphones, something that was emphasized repeatedly in the iPhone 7 launch event (and if you want to charge your phone while also wearing headphones, that's your only option). Which leads us to...2) AirPods aren't included. Apple's new wireless earbuds do look awesome. They'll work with Siri. And the Apple Watch. And automatically pair with all of your Apple devices over iCloud. But they're $159, and won't be available until late October. So, be sure not to lose that dongle before then.3) Dual-lens camera is only available in 7+. Apple boasts that the new dual-lens camera is the best on the market, and with a real zoom lens and the ability to do all sorts of slick depth-of-field tricks, it may indeed smoke all other smartphone cameras. Too bad it's only available in the iPhone 7+. If you opt for the smaller, less expensive iPhone 7, you still get a camera that beats the one in the iPhone 6, thanks to a better lens and image stabilization,  but it's not the best on the market, is it?4) It's going to get all scratched up. Cult of Mac points out that Apple has warned that that new, cool jet black paint job is more susceptible to ""fine micro-abrasions"" than other colors. Not that it really matters, since...5) You'll need to buy a new case. Sure, despite a new color, the iPhone 7 looks almost identical to the 6/6s models it replaces. But looks can be deceiving. While the dimensions of the iPhone 7 are indeed nearly identical to those of last year's models, its new cameras mean that the camera cutout on many older cases won't fit right. And instead of a headphone cutout at the bottom, you'll need a case with dual speaker cutouts for the iPhone 7's new stereo speakers. Bottom line: Be prepared to spluge on a new case to go with your new phone.6) It's not waterproof. You may see references to the iPhone 7 being waterproof, but it's not. Apple refers to it as being ""splash, water and dust resistant,"" and warns that its resistance level could ""decrease as a result of normal wear."" The company also warns that the phone's warranty doesn't cover liquid damage, so you may want to avoid any temptation to take your new iPhone into the shower with you.7) It's an iPhone. If you're a fan, that's great. But if you're one of the millions of Android owners out there (and globally, Android's market share is much bigger than that of Apple's iOS), it was just another opportunity to point out how much better your favorite platform is (not that Android phones don't have their share of problems).",iPhone 7
This is the best phone.if you are a business man or a photographer you can buy this iPhone.please press yes if this article is helpful!,iPhone 7
Camera quality is good but not pretty much.,iPhone 7
Iphone aur other phone me kya parak hai.,iPhone 7
why only 6 moths warranty on inbox accessories?Apple aleays give one years????,iPhone 7
Does this iphone is 100% genuine and comes with original bill,iPhone 7
"Dear all ,Don't even think of buying this overpriced phone.It's not worth of 60k.Here are the issues am facing.Touch ID poor in response because every time you have to wake up the phone to acces through Touch IDPhone has freezing issues while receiving the calls.While surfing you can observe phone heating up.Am highly disappointed with the performance of this phone.So please don't spend too much",iPhone 7
"at this date iphone 7 32gb is available for 50k. i believe that this could be the best price to buy this phone; but is it worth spending 50k? within a month from now samsung s8 is going to be in market, according to the promotion videos and leaks s8 is going to be the best and most beautiful phone ever. surely s8 will be the best looking phone with a lot of features nd other cool stuffs which other brands don't offer. but then people will judge me based on an os platform, its ios or its apple nd all. i would like you to be aware that apple is also going to make huge changes this year as their 10th anniversary and according to leaks and rumors all over the Internet it will somewhat look like Samsung s8 with edge display. you can check on youtube for visual ideas. my recommendation is that keep your hard earned money 50k for upcoming releases, if u are apple fan then u can go for iphone edition or if u wouldn't mind going to android then s8 is going to be the best phone this year. for me 50k is a huge amount of money, if 50k is just your pocket money and u think you can save another 50k till sept. then only u can think of buying iphone7. Because after the release of new iphone edition (or iphone 8 whatever apple is going to name it) iphone 7 is going to loose its value to very much extent. if u will go to sell 7 32gb then the chances arw u wont get more than 30k, and next iphone is surely be going to start at a price of 70-80k. so think wisely and analyse your needs and spend your money. 50k is not earned with a blink of eye.",iPhone 7
we indians are fools v wast money every time they release new iPhone don't buy because of the brand.there is no feature in iPhone 7 when compare to previous iPhone 6s.so don't updated wait for next year there is gotta be something special for 10th anniversary.,iPhone 7

Those who want to purchase I phone please have a look atleast once on Lenevo vibe shot it's far better than iPhone 7 I have been using vibe shot for one year there is no complain in this itsa sexiest phone.,iPhone 7
"iphone 7 is not a good phone, samsung galaxy ace NXT is best phone in d world.I am currently using NXT..",iPhone 7
Product not working. Carrier not getting detected at all. Please look into it.,iPhone 7
I bought this 3-4 years back.. It was very good for the price at that time ~45k.. Today the price is 25k which I feel is too much.. If it were between 10-15k I would buy it again..,iPhone 7
"Though this is an old product, it still works like a charm. Bought this for my mother, so that we could also use FaceTime and iMessage. It meets her requirement.She did have unlearning and learning curve, but she is back to her usual schedule in a month or so.Regular updates means she can have the latest security updates. So I don’t have to worry about security for her phone, unlike her last Andriod phone.Big plus point is that unnecessary apps don’t get installed easily. Saves me a lot of time cleaning her phone upPlus it’s a premium phone, comparatively...",iPhone 7
Don’t buy Apple products. If you receive defective product amazon will not return and ask you to visit Apple store even in this Corona time. It like playing with other life. This is worse service from online company.Worst iPhone experience.,iPhone 7
"This is my second iOS device. I already own a 10.5 ipad pro. I am buying this in 2019 just because i wanted a good quality sleek and small phone to carry everywhere. I’ve always been an Android user in terms of mobile phones.Pros:I am really happy with the build quality. It feels strong and sturdy. iOS is fantastic and no lag at all so far.Cons:The biggest problem is the battery life. Even if I don’t use it, the battery drains itself by 5-7% in 1 hour. Secondly iOS doesn’t provide freedom as Android. The most annoying issue with iOS is Very limited compatibility with true caller. I get 20-30 calls a day and most of those are SPAMS. In iPhone i can not identify those as there is no caller id. This is really annoying and the biggest reason I may switch back to Android soon.Apart from that, it’s costly in 2019 when other brands in Android provides. flagship grade features.",iPhone 7
"Apple and Amazon are taking customers for a ride. Only talking (either by Whatsapp or carrier) and some videos on Whattsapp, we were getting 18 hours initially, now down to < 10 hours (within 12 days) .Apart from this, the phone is getting heating up rapidly. If the conversation is more than 30 mins, we cannot hold the phone - we have to use the earphones as mandatory.I am using 2nos iphone 6, and one iphone 4 is lying unused. Apart from this, I have 2 Ipads.My daughter purchased Redme Note 9 (in exchange of another Redme) Battery awesome, even with God knows how many Apps running together.  This phone was purchased the same day as Apple.Paying price of only trusting Apple Brand.",iPhone 7
After using for 10 days I can say that no doubt this is a high end phone and it gives you a completely different experience with camera and in terms of user experience but please note that its battery seems dead always. You need to carry power bank to keep your phone working always.Pros:1. Interface is really good.2. Camera quality is too goodCons:1. Way too costly2. Battery issue ( Drains too fast)3. Heats up quickly if you play a gameOne Plus 7 is a way better choice at this price.,iPhone 7
"At the reduced price points during the sale with cashback and instant discounts on offer, this phone is a no brainer to go for. Considering Apple's rather silly pricing of the 8/8+/X/XS/XR the iPhone 7 is still a very capable phone. Best part is the new home button (no more hardware failures) and with the latest versions of iOS it still remains fast and responsive.People will have to get used to the lack of a headphone jack but if paired with a good quality wireless headset, it is a non issue. Battery life does well too.Amazon's exchange process is easy and trouble free.",iPhone 7
"iPhone is a great device, because of the tight integration of hardware and software. This is my second iPhone and I have purchased it on 2018 (2 yrs after release) because I think 40,000 is max I am willing to spend on this device.Ok, so I like Android too, I'm a owner of Nexus 6P too, so I know what pure Android feels like, but because security is better on iOS, I use iOS too.I'm writing this review after 5 days of use. Battery life is good. Specially on standby. Screen size is on sweet spot. 4.7 inch doesn't feel too small, not too large. (I prefer my 6P to consume multimedia content).Stereo speakers are good. Bass is great, and they are clear. Sound that come from this device is really good.32GB internal storage definitely going to feel less in some time but as I said I'm not going to use this for multimedia consumption, so I think it's ok.Camera is good. Low light is not as great as I'm used to be on my Google device, but still on proper lighting, it's better than 6P.Build quality is excellent. It's feel like a premium piece of metal. And this matte Black finish looks really cool. It's feel like I'm holding a Batman's phone or something.Features on iOS 12.1 are good too. Device is smooth and fast. Getting 60fps animations throughout the UI.I love both OS, so I like to carry both Android and iOS device.All an all, this is a great phone with fast SoC (A10 fusion) and well optimised hardware with software. If you will be able to buy it under 35000, you're making a correct decision. This device deserve 40K (currently) without any question.Hope this review will be helpful to you.",iPhone 7
I shall be highly obliged to inform you that apple iPhones 7 is a best option at 30k range.all letest  features & basic features are awesome but screen monitoring features & radiation of WiFi/Bluetooth are very poor quality. Battery performance is averaged. Mainly the apple iPhone 7 have volatile and non-volatile memory 😀,iPhone 7
"Received the product within a hour landed in iphone care, due to hearing issue as well the metal body has a shock effect, you cannot return since it shows go to apple store amazon is not responsible",iPhone 7
"Got it from Appario Retail.Genuine, brand new, sealed in original packaging.(no lightning to 3.5mm converter however, no longer shipped I think, doesn’t looked like removed)Bill with IMEI and serial no. However will request a better copy as the one came along won’t last long.Assembled in India product as mentioned on box as well as on phone.Got registered automatically when started first. There is warranty info in settings which mentions expiry date exactly one year after.Battery is good like any other phone. Shows the health 100%. Easily last a day with normal usage.Don’t need to mention anything about phone features. If you know Apple, you know what you are buying.",iPhone 7
well i needed to be back on iphone...was using pixel 2xl for a while because of its incredible camera...but otherwise i have been iphone user for past 3-4 years...this is the best looking iphone for me...so always wanted to have it in black color...missed it in sale in december...but got it dis tym for 33k dat includes discount on hdfc cards...camera is pretty average as per pixels standard...battery lyf as usual is poor...n iphone user wid charger or powerbank in hand is a common site in offices...but den ios 12 is buttery smooth on this...so far loving it.,iPhone 7
Extremely fast delivery. Amazing and stylish phone.If you are charging from the standard home plug then there isn't any overheating.It's heating when charging from the laptop using data cable.Also not good for low light photography.,iPhone 7
"I have been using this phone since 2017. Still works perfectly fine even today 4th of March 2019. The screen quality is good, also the battery, camera and sound quality is good. Also if you want to play games like PUBG, it works totally fine on the best graphics setting. It’s a good phone and is quiet durable. 2 years and still going.",iPhone 7
"Compared to the price the features and the quality that iPhones offer now make them too over priced. Also, Apple is not at all bothered about the Indian market. Apple maps does not support directions and other important search features. iPhone always need WiFi to backup and install apps larger than 150 MB. Now when I get 40 GB per month, of 4g data, for a plan of ~300 rupees why should I bother about WiFi.",iPhone 7
Compact and elegant.Decent battery life.Need a case to protect the phone.,iPhone 7
"After using for a period of 2 months I got a problem with its cameraU can yourself see in the picture, there is a spot in the pictureNow the spots are increasingVery bad experience",iPhone 7
Really liked the product. Awesomely fast and very smooth to use. Looks awesome too and feels very premium in hand. But the phone slips if u have a sweaty hand. Make sure u get some good cover. I mostly use Power Saving after checking what it exactly does and I get an awesome battery life too..,iPhone 7
The phone works great with its OS with great balance between performance and capabilities of all the apps that functions well. No need for the over exaggerated rams and processors sold by androids. When you just want things to work this iPhone does it well.,iPhone 7
The phone is excellent quality and delivered in less than 1 day.,iPhone 7
"Perfect iPhone for not so much into camera people. Has all the latest updates, fingerprint sensor is great and size is perfect for one hand use. The only choice is battery size. 32 is too less.",iPhone 7
product is as seen and with good quality.I have received my product in good condition.The Durability and Quality of the product is very good.,iPhone 7
"I was a android user and bought this beauty in 2018 ,still it’s worth to buy this , what a performance. I start love this IOS . Apps are very well controlled and it’s help for this lack less performance. New haptic engine and Touch ID, water resistant, makes this phone as stunning one .",iPhone 7
"Just does what it's meant for. A gift for mom, she finds it convenient.Battery life is short.",iPhone 7
"I was skeptical buying a phone online, but took the chance on Amazon. I have used the phone for a year + and its still going strong. The battery life is not as great as it used to be after using for one year +.",iPhone 7
"Just for a brand name, purchased this but believe me that in the name of a IPhone it is just a simple phone. From my point of view, 5000 rs smartphones have better features than this. Don't ever buy Apple products like this.",iPhone 7
Network goes again & again. Speed is too slow. Need to restart again & again to get decent speed.Didn't get service from Amazon in returning. 2-3 complains dodge yet no action taken. I will never use Apple again even using Apple from last 10 years.Apple service is no more satisfactory now.,iPhone 7
Awesome 😊 Lovely! This one os superb and performance is also good.,iPhone 7

"Its unfortunate that item received within a week turned out to be defective where other party ""simply cant"" hear my voice. It seems to be working fine only with earphone. Resetting the phone by wiping out the data did not help. Issue seems to be consistent across multiple service providers SIM.Now its with apple service center for further diagnostics.Even if you buy an expensive phone, its not guaranteed to work  and to have piece of mind. This is how they manufacture defective product and make money.",iPhone 7
"Using it for a week, loving it so far. I usually stretch any phone's performance by playing heavy duty games, installing lots of apps and frequently app switching. The phone is keeping up well so far. After switching from android, it takes some time to get used to it. But the phone's performance and camera quality are superb. Battery life lasts longer than my nexus 5x. I was sceptical about the 2GB ram but it hasn't disappointed me so far. Pretty happy about it!",iPhone 7
"First, I was very much skeptical to order an iPhone over the internet, be is amazon or flipkart, I still feel its the luck factor when you still get your costly devices in hand one piece as they should be; given the terrified instances we have seen with many retailers. I understand there's little control over these things, even from amazon's perspective (which they are doing a splendid job), I feel the onus completely lies on the retailer.Alright, so the core part of this......Amazing, superb, splendid, awesome, classic...I feel short on adjectives to define this masterpiece...Apple,,,I have started to fall in love with Apple devices. I have resisted them over the years, but now I realize I have 3 of them....you can choose to ignore but can't resist.A simple, yet powerful device, makes your life hell lot easy...powered packed components. One thing which I admire about this is that they dont need jazzy advertisements or fake ratings to promote apple devices, they are build the way you wouldn't hate them. Although the ram seems to be less, the memory management is so efficient that you dont have to bother on clearing the cache (unlike android).Display is superb, crystal clear...just make sure you get a tempered glass, and it adds an additional beauty to this. i still wonder when you made such an excellent device, why cant apple build the glass that way.So far I feel 32 GB is enough although I have started taking more pictures...you'll feel the need to do it given the camera quality. They should have given an option for potrait mode (with some additional price ofcourse). This is for someone who dont want a large screen but needs a dual camera and potrait mode. Still I am pretty much happy with the picture quality and the composition.I like the touch button and the level of customization available.overall, not regretting the decision at all...happy about it....I think I made the right choice.",iPhone 7
"The Apple iPhone 7 (Black) is a step ahead from the previous iPhones. I previously used the iPhone 6 and this one has a lot many new features like 3D Touch, Force Touch, Live Photos and the phone is a lot more faster too. The new iOS works swift and fast and is very suitable for the the 7. Amazon offered a great deal on the phone during Diwali and I got it for about 37,500. Amazon delivery was straight up; the phone was seal packed and retains the apple 1 year warranty. The matte black is a great colour, relatively harder to scratch than the jet black version too. This one has a very subtle look to it; un-exagerated and un-boastful in appearance.For new iPhone users, this is a competitive price to start off with the iPhone experience. Apple makes very simplistic designs and has a clear philosophy. The phone does not allow for much customisability options but in itself is content.Great deal made the Diwali a happy one.Product Quality: 10/10Price Value: 10/10-soothsayer",iPhone 7
"An Iphone is an Iphone.....World's best phone.Prior to iphone i was using Xiaomi Mi5 . Specs wise Mi5 has has better specs as compared to Iphone 7 like 16 MP camera, Full HD Screen and light weight. But these specs are just for marketing gimmicks these cheap android phone manufacturer doesn't know how built a quality product.  One thing i have learned is specs doesnt always matter it's hardware and software integration that matters.1. Good Screen Quality: Even though my mi5 has full hd ips screen but iphone's screen is far better . Numbers doesn't matter.2. Camera: Iphone's 12 MP rear camera is far better than most of the android phone. Mi5 16 MP Camera does't match half the quality of iphone's.3. Processor's : Iphone's A10 Fusion processor is the fastest processor in the world.and sinc it has been designed by  apple's itself so there is better integration and use of processor in iphone. In terms of speed and responsiveness there no match for Qualcomn snapdragon SOC.4. Hardware and software integration: Since apple controls both hardware and software. Iphone 7 has 2 gb ram and there is no lag even when using 7-8 apps simultaneously. Mi5 has 3 gb ram but it still get slow and hangs many a times.5.",iPhone 7
"Bought this recently during the great Indian sale for 38000Rs (offer price 39999Rs minus 1500Rs on HDFC credit card minus 500 Rs ( got cash back)for adding 5000 Rs in my amazon pay balance account ).______________________________________________________________________________________Product delivered on time with NO DAMAGE and WELL PACKED.______________________________________________________________________________________Bought a phone online for the first time and satisfied with what I received. Everything  is working perfectly.______________________________________________________________________________________ADVICE WHILE BUYING A PHONE ONLINE:1) check the bill and box . IMEI number should match with the bill and box provided.  .2)to be on a safer side take a video while unboxing. (There have been cases of people not getting their money back even after they getting a different product ).3)check all the features of the phone that includesa)  is it able to read the SIM card ?b) look for any scratches or damage/crack on your screenc) check the camera ( both front and back )d) fingerprint scan should be working properlye) is it able to record your voice and activate SIRI?f) call your family member and check the function of the speaker and microphoneg) other minor things to check - FaceTime,iMessage,wifi , mobile internet /4g ,Phone speaker,etch)check the volume buttons and the earphone jack which is defective a lot of times when you buy online__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Which  iPHONE 7  to buy ? 32GB  V/S  128GB  V/S  256GB?the difference between the iPHONE 7 - 32GB(45,990Rs) ,128GB(56,999Rs)  &  256 GB(62,998Rs)  is the PRICE and STORAGE capacityADVICE:  iCLOUD is providing  5GB of FREE storage.  IF you want ADDITIONAL STORAGE the pricing is as follows : >>>50GB- Rs 75/month .  PER YEAR  it comes to 75*12=900Rs(for 1 year )...1,800Rs(for 2 years)...2,700Rs (for 3 years) >>>200 GB- Rs220/month.  PER YEAR it comes to 220*12=2,640Rs(for 1 year )...5,280Rs(for 2 years )...7,920Rs(for 3 years ) >>>2TB- Rs 750/month. PER YEAR it comes to 750*12=9,000Rs(for 1 year )...18,000Rs(for 2 years )...27,000Rs(for 3 years )IF YOU WANT ADDITIONAL STORAGE GO FOR THE 32GB  iPHONE 7 and buy the iCLOUD plan accordingly. YOU WILL END UP SAVING A LOT OF MONEY .__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________INSURANCE FOR YOUR IPHONE?Yes it is always good to have insurance for your iPhone. (My brother lost his iPhone 7 Plus 128 gb during ganpati visarjan but got  45K back due to insurance.)_____________________________________________________________________________________IPHONE 7  V/S  IPHONE 8 . WHAT TO BUY ?If you already have an iPhone 7 there is no point wasting money for the iPhone 8 . You may wait for the iPhone 10.If you compare iPhone 7 and 8 the iPhone 8 is just going to be a bit faster than the older iPhone 7. Lot more processing ,opens faster and faster gaming than iPhone 7. No major changes to get excited about .Prices of the iPhone 7 and 7 plus have come down drastically and I would recommend going for the 7/7plus . If you have the money and are willing to wait then you can go for the iPhone 10.NOTE: will update my review after unboxing  iPhone 8 and 10.**********UPDATE (8th OCTOBER 2017)************Apple investigates reports iPhone 8 Plus batteries BURST OPEN while phone charges. After this news I feel that people should not buy the new iPhone 8/8plus and iPhone X till this matter is solved .Will KEEP on UPDATING.............",iPhone 7
"Got this iPhone 7 black 32gb at 43k while it costs 56k at imagine store. I had read so many positive as well as negative reviews before buying it online. I was very confused whether I will be getting a fresh, seal-packed iPhone made for Indian market or something imported from abroad or something defective. I had another option to get it from gulf countries where it would cost around 44k but that wont have been accepted in Indian apple customer services for free repairing/ warranty.Finally I decided to buy it online and I don’t regret it. I got a original product and it is running smoothly w/o any issue. You can go for this seller while buying a iPhone.",iPhone 7
"Apple it is. Another elegantly designed master piece from Apple. Benchmark performance in all aspects... camera, sound, display, user interface, performance, touch screen, fingerprint sensor, apps, design, dimension, optimization and most importantly reliability. Even after a year of use and fully loaded with apps the performance is extremely fluid. As always with any of the apple gadgets hardware and software integration highly optimized and reliable.",iPhone 7
The battery life of this product is so much better that iPhone 5s and 6s. The colour is really good and I think Apple should have continued with this colour. The size is perfect. It’s not to big as the plus series. Definitely a good buy. There is hardly any difference between iPhone 7 and iPhone 8. So I would suggest you go for this product as is cheaper as well.,iPhone 7
Nothing to Say.Apple is Apple.I m an existing Samsung Note 4 user and have been using Androids from many years and specifically Samsung Phones.It takes some time for you to get familiar with Apple.But I can say overall the below things-.. Overall build quality is good... Feels premium in hand..Installed ios 11 update..Gold feels good in hand for men as per Me...Smooth Fluid IOS UI..REAR n Front Cam are good..As I m new to this new some time to understand the overall phone features to find CONS.Must buy as per me....Buy some leather back cover and tempered glass from.amazon to protect the device.,iPhone 7
"Awesome phone with a better battery than most of the Android phones. Trust me, it's worth every penny u pay for it. Software n hardware sync superbly. Camera is as good as a dslr. I very strongly recommend Apple instead of the boring Android.",iPhone 7
"iPhone is always iPhone..... It is 100% original genuine product. It is also certified by Apple. I just love it. Thanks Amazon for my first iPhone. It is a really Intelligent device. I recommend those want to really buy a smart and inteligent phone. It is really worth to buy. Try to use once, you will love it... It is my personal experience.",iPhone 7
"Little difficult when you migrate from other OS based mobile. I have used Lumia phones for many years and then migrated to Android last year. Thanks to Redmi revolution in India. I bought 3s Prime last year but it last for only 8 months. Because of some issues, that didn’t work. Amazon big billion day started exactly at the same time. Thank god, I am able to grab 1 offer and that’s when I became an iphone user. Now, iphone 7 is on my hands. Amazing transition experience till date but struggling a bit to get used to this. Hope this lasts for a ling time like my earlier Nokia Lumia. Thanks Apple. Hope to have a bonding with you for more years ahead!",iPhone 7
"It's an iPhone (Period).  (new piece was not activated previously, got it from cloud tail so felt secure).",iPhone 7
"Satisfactory move from android to iOS. Though I’m new to iOS, it didn’t trouble me much to get adjusted and used to.My personal opinion is it’s the best mobile if you are looking for a long run like 2+ years. At this time around 35k it’s the better  mobile no doubt. I haven’t seen much comparable differences between apple 7 and 8.Samsung S8 and LG G6 are on top of it,  S8 is around 55k and G6 is around same price to apple 7 but when it comes to durability and long run I doubt.",iPhone 7
My 1st iPhone. It took one day time to get used to iOS as I was an Android user earlier. Whatever work you perform with this mobile you can feel it's quality. Call clarity is amazing. Camera clarity and music are truly excellent. Inhand you can experience the elegance. Happy for buying this @38000 rupees in a flash deal.,iPhone 7
The rear camera of my iPhone 7 is showing black shade (about 3-4 centimetres in diameter) while capturing photos or videos.Never expected this from Apple I am switching to some other brand after 6 years of being Apple user.Very disappointed with Apple.,iPhone 7
"Got mine from 'Darshita Electronics' on a great deal of about 39k. Was wondering if I would get genuine product since I usually buy electronics from 'cloudtail'. Turns out the 'Darshita Electronics' was a 100% genuine Apple product. Don't worry, just close your eyes and buy. It's an iPhone, you already know how good it is. It just simply works no issues, no hangups.",iPhone 7
"Wowww..........  that was the my reaction when I received iPhone 7 .....genuine product and no defects....good job amazon,fast delivery.  I don't know about others but trust me it's good",iPhone 7
"Whole body heated during charging and during operation. Defective mobile sent to me. It is mentioned in my order that it may return until 7th October but when I opt for return due to heating problem, I am getting a message that go for a technical support from the I Phone centre. Why the discrepancy is there.Why you are not taking back the defective Mobile.When mobile is defective you have to take back as specifically mentioned that return is acceptable until 7october",iPhone 7
"Fab deal!! Fab Product.I am happy that i have purchased this from amazon.Amazon has always been the best platform for me to buy anything.This time i purchased Iphone-7.

"i am reviewing this iphone after 8 months ..Five stars for delivery and quality for this iphone 7 and amazon .. but this 1 star for ios updates .. every month its keep on coming updates.. but with every update facing some issue .. like sudden call drop , network error , hanging , fingerprint issue soooo many ....never update your iphone ..",iPhone 7

42499/- loved it,iPhone 7
Genuine product and I needed the phone to be delivered on some specific day at some specific address and it was done. Really happy with the service,iPhone 7
"Cons:-Its Bend from the corners, when placed on the floor the sides of the phone shakes-I was expecting an Air pods with it but unfortunately its earpods  (normal iphone earphones)-When on call, cannot hear the person speaking on the other side, voice is not audible enough-Trying for the replacement but it always gets me connected to a tech support URL.",iPhone 7
"I had my worries when being purchased by amazon, after seeing so many reports of fake products shipped for the moneyThis product is genuine and could see the product information in the apple website, and product had no issues so far",iPhone 7
It was delivered much ahead if commitment. Just a day Amazon took to deliver the product. It is a pleasant experience. Product performs very well as per my expectation.,iPhone 7
"The iPhone 7's notable camera, battery and water resistance improvements are a worthwhile upgrades to a familiar phone design, but ask yourself if you really need an upgrade...and if the Plus might be a better choice.  GOOD SIDEs  (+)______________# Improved cameras very well,# The front with 7 MP camera is giving you really good pictures.# Even the back shooter also is a very good camera.# Beautiful design# Screen and battery life is also improved# Water resistance# Tap-tic engine feedback is neat# Powerful dual speakers# Starts at 32GB, finally# Ios 10, it actually really works well with the hardware of the phone. Every thing run smoothly, looking from gaming to test massaging or browsing the web at the same time, every thing is very smooth# Software update is always on time, this is the apple's best thing  BAD SIDEs  (-)____________# No headphone jack# Iterative design# Many of the ""groundbreaking"" features have been on Android phones for a while# Wireless audio ecosystem is immature# Jet Black model scratches easilyReasons to BUY The iPhone 7_________________________# VERY FAST.... Giving apple A10 fusion chip, which is 40% faster than previous, as well as 50% faster graphics.# FLASH DRIVE.... If you are worried about storage, then, SanDisk offering ""iXpand"" Flash drive upto 128 gb at 8500/- Rs.product link  >((  http://www.amazon.in/SanDisk-iXpand-Flash-iPhones-Computers/dp/B01F6RWV94/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1499795607&sr=1-1&keywords=external%2Bdrive%2Bfor%2Biphone&th=1  ))# WATER & DUST RESISTANCE.... Now the iPhone 7 has IP67 water resistance, no need to worry about the water under 15 cm.# CAMERAS..... We have some great cameras on iPhone 7 or 7 plus. Now iPhone 7 has optical stabilization, which something we didn't having in previous iPhone, also get 1.8 aperture. And 7 MP front facing camera which will give decent photos, also 1080p video recording from front.#STEREO SPEAKERS.....  This time around we don't have 1 speaker, we have 2 speakers, one at the top and one at the bottom. they are very loud, which is really need.# COLOR... Now iPhone comes with beautiful jet black and matte black. You will fall in love with the phone. Reasons NOT To Buy The iPhone 7_____________________________# DESIGN.... Apple making almost same design from so many generation. Its nice to having something nice, some thing new. all other competitors are trying for something new.# CAMERA BUMP..... The camera bump looks ugly, If apple had make the device a little bit thicker, there would be no camera bump, and you have the space for BIGGER BATTERY, which will made big deference. It have longer life battery because of optimization of new processor.# BATTERY..... We still don't have the fast charging or wireless charging. Now wireless charging  i get not everybody use this, But fast charger we really need for this. Yes we have fast charger with iPad, but we need fast charger along the iPhone itself, which will charge faster.# HEAD PHONE JACK..... This is a too much of big a deal, Yes they are giving lightning converter, but if you listening something to your headphone wide, working on your phone, and you need to charge, that will be big issue.# MICRO SD CARD SLOT.... Specially i really miss the absence of Micro SD card slot. I think every body is. We really need micro SD slot on iPhone for more space option. But yeah this option will little bit slow down to iPhone performance.# CUSTOMIZABILITY ON IOS.... If you are a person that really like to customize your phone, then ios is definitely not for you.So that is it. Thank You.I THINK IT WILL HELP YOU.Thank you Amazon India",iPhone 7
Excellent phone. Apple signature symbol on the back in more pronounced hue could have been more appealing.,iPhone 7
Received phone in good condition on time. Have used it for sometime. No problem has occurred till now.  Would recommend.,iPhone 7
The iPhone7 did not have the 3.5mm headphone jack adapter & ear pods with lightning connectors. They were missing from the box.The phone catalogue says it includes with the phone.,iPhone 7
The only way I feel good about my Iphone7 is when I compare it with MotoG3 else I find even MotoG3 better than this phone. And now even Amazon is not taking it back.please don't go for this mobile.Saune pe suhaga worst Amazon service. I am sure one will regret after buying.,iPhone 7

Apple is the best...and so its iPhone! Wait for some good offer and buy it. And there is much more in iphones than just camera. Just need to explore and learn it !,iPhone 7

"NEVER BUY IPHONE FROM AMAZON! FRAUD LOG!I bought iphone 7 in September 2017. After using the phone for just 6 months, I am facing several issues- Battery not charging, Device automatic restart and calling time sensors not working. I visited the authorized apple service center (B2X Service solution India Pvt. Ltd, City Center mall, Gurugram). The service center denied to repair the product after the initial diagnosis as they found unauthorized modifications in the device and they mentioned that display and battery cowlin is missing and there exists some fingerprint marks as well. The authorized service center has declined to repair the device, and as per them the phone is not covered under warranty as per Apple VMI Guidelines.",iPhone 7

"Seven is the first iPhone I ever owned. Always loved the product but shied away because of the price tag. But this time I said ""what the heck"" and took the plunge. Love the phone since day 1. There are lot of arguments out there saying ""why do u need such an expensive phone?"", ""There are phones lower the cost with lot more features"" etc. But it all comes down to choice. What all features you need. To me battery life is very important. This black box of wonder gives me two days of battery life with moderate usage (no games. This is not a gaming machine to me). That feature really helps when I am travelling. I hate charging my phones at travel ports. Then the seamless connectivity that it has with other electronics and the wonderful apps just make the price tag worth it. All said, buy the phone only if the features suit your need.",iPhone 7
"Iphone 7 is the best device out there.A 4.7 inch device with premium build quality and buttery smooth performance with the best camera ever made #compared with Google_Pixel# though looks similar to iphone 6 and 6s believe me its so much better even with same pixels as iphone 6 and iphone 6s its a lot better in color representation.  Let me devide this revies into pro's and con'sPro's:-1)running on the latest version of ios 10.3.3 and ios 11 beta it runs buttery smooth without any lag and without any effort defeat's pixel2)3d touch adds many functionality such as accesing the mobile data from the home screen3) even with the aluminium metal back no heating issues4)military grade build quality3)sound output through sterio speakers is excellent and through headphones is best in the market4)even with 750 pixels trust me the display is excellent5)antenna bands are perfectly blended into the body6)cellular call quality is excellent and there is loss of music quality through the lightening connector to 3.5 mm adapter7)camera with electronic image stabilization is just awesome no words,the best in the marketCon's:-1)battery is only about 1850mah which is pretty average in 20172)no fast charging takes about 2 hours for 0-100% charging and battery comes almost a day3)no 3.5 mm pin in the phone,a dongle is provided in the box for regular 3.5 mm headphones but if lost costs about ₹800IF U LIKE LIKE MY REVIEW PLEASE GIVE A THUMB'S UP",iPhone 7
Placed my order late night at 11:30 PM and got delivered at 8 AM amazingly fast !!! Phone came with nice packaging and working great. Phone came with iOS 10.3.1 out of the box and update to 10.3.2 was available.,iPhone 7
There is nothing like a black I phone ! It's a true beauty ! I donot even have to speak about the quality and build as it is the best in the market . I think to come up with a 32 gb model is the smartest move . You can always buy space in iCloud it's cheaper and safer than investing further on memory .,iPhone 7
Execellent phone. An iPhone doesn't need too many words. Works flawlessly. However not much different from 6 or 6s. Buy only if upgrading from an earlier model or first iPhone.,iPhone 7
It's value for moneyThe product is as expected. Battery life is good. One day compete usage with 4G and still you are left with around 10% battery. Overall a great product. Purchased 15 days prior to this review.,iPhone 7
"From being a hardcore android fan, I have made the move to iPhone 7.Why did I move:1. Smooth, fast os that is always on the latest versionThe os is optimised beyond belief. Its been close to a month, and the response time is ridiculous. Even with lower specs, the iPhone delivers an experience unlike any other2. Quality of appsNot one app has crashed. Each app is extremely responsive, and the change to the physical button, with 3d touch have made the customisations absolutely amazing3. SecurityIt is the most secure operating system. Period. No app can read your messages, or request to make calls on your behalf. In the long run, it is definitely a more closed environment, which works perfectly for meElephant in the room: No Jack! Well, yes. Has it impacted me - no. Why? Because i already had bluetooth headphones. And when they are discharged, I have the apple headphones provided with the phoneBattery: Gets through a day easily (with about 6 hours of screen on time). My moto x pure never gave me more than 4 hours SoT. Also, the low power mode is an absolute beastThings that took some getting used to/could help if added:1. Smart shortcuts (being able to see which wifi you are connected to via one swipe)2. Long press shortcuts to launch settings",iPhone 7

I just 2 weeks this phone is cold dead.  I cannot even power on this phone no matter what I try  finally I have to take this phone to Apple care Centre Just two weeks? is this even justify for a top band like apple. Perhaps I will not buy Apple Products  anymore in India,iPhone 7
My experience with iphone 7 is unpleasant. I wrote you sometime back about it's bugging call forwarding application. I have since experienced less sensitive home button.,iPhone 7

"This is my first time buying iPhone, All I can say is buy it and you will have best experience ever. I love the matte black & I am glad that I choose this color over silver iPhone :)If you are buying for first time then I suggest iPhone 7 is the best.It's simply awesome.",iPhone 7

awesome no words to explain my feeling. super fast charging and superb battery backup as usual.,iPhone 7
I have not opened box yet but I don't feel that I need to wait for it to update review..iPhone is unbeatable,iPhone 7
I have been using apple products from past 4-5 years and I never really though of buying another android phone available this days in the market.The only problem is battery life and you can not expend the memory of this but over all it will never hang like other phones no matter how much you use and for many years.No phones are better than iphone.Totally satisfied with it.,iPhone 7
"The iPhone 7 was launched back in 2016 and was an instant hit when it launched, similar to other iPhones. Also similar to iPhones is just how well this phone has aged. Compared to other flagships released at that time, the iPhone 7 has better performance and has even held on to it's value well. But it's 2019, and there is a ton of competition where the iPhone 7 stands. First thing's first, if you're not adamant about getting an iPhone, don't consider the iPhone 7. The OnePlus 6T is one phone which can be bought at a similar price point and is better in almost every way.If you have to buy an iPhone at this price point, the iPhone 7 is still a solid device. It has-1. Decent display2. Decent performance3. Will still get software updates for the next 2 years.4. Good resale value5. Good bragging value6. Compact size7. A more secure software experience8. Very good cameraAll in all, you get the benefits of the iOS eco system as a whole when you buy the iPhone 7. All the components of the phone today are what we can call great but not mind blowing. To someone looking for a compact, well rounded smartphone with 2-3 years of usable life left, I would whole heartedly recommend the iPhone 7. However, if the price was closer to the Rs 30K segment, this phone would have been absolutely killer.",iPhone 7
Phone was amazing as expected i was supposed to received in two day delivery although i received late in night. But was excited. Totally working good..!! Good overall experience with amazon.,iPhone 7
"I bought this in October 2017. I got it at an amazing price. It was last year's flagship at that time and I couldn't have been happier. I was used to phones from Xiaomi at that point so I was looking forward to exploring this. I already had a Macbook Air and this made perfect sense.2017: Love at first sightI was blown away by the performance of the device. It just works perfectly; there is no lag; the camera is just awesome and takes perfect pictures and the video quality is just amazing! The sound quality via headphones is one of the best I have heard and the dual speakers works wonders! The battery life is also decent; I was expecting very bad battery life but it is good, it last 1 and half days which is awesome for such a thin and light phone.2018: The cracks start to appearThe phone is performing perfectly. I can see using it till at least 2021. It is still a beast; I don't play many games but it does the trick; however there are some nuances:1. I got a 32 GB version of the phone which got filled really fast and iCloud only allows 5 GB so I had to upgrade. It was only Rs 75/- per month for 50 GB so its fine.2. I can't download music without iTunes and it is pretty annoying. I made my own song and cannot load it on my phone. I have 2 computers, a Macbook Air and a desktop. I can't import music from the desktop as it is locked to my MAC. My MAC is having issues of it's own which means I can't load music to my phone without losing whatever is already there. This is beyond stupid.3. I can't turn off bluetooth or wifi. Turning it off via the quick toggle disconnects it and doesn't turn it off. Why would anyone want to just disconnect without turning it off?4. The lightning cable broke. I ordered a replacement and it didn't work after a few days. Turns out you need an apple certified cable which costs over Rs 500 (at least); so that's more money down the drain.5. I bought apple music which costs Rs 120 permonth as it is easier to attach a damn cable everytime I want new music. I know I can do it wirelessly but I would prefer doing it without a computer. It is a smartphone; should it be able to just add music to my music play list?6. I don't know what Apple did but the battery life is now horrible. I bought Baseus 5000 mAH charging case and my phone feels like a brick now. Still worth it as it runs for 3 days straight!7. I can't seem to take pictures in 16:9 aspect ratio. The camera app doesn't have that option.8. Youtube just punishes apple devices; every other video I play will always have an ad. I have an android phone as well and I only get ads may be once every 5 videos.I am using the same account on both devices.9. I removed apps like Amazon, Flipkart and stuff; it just eats space and I  only have 32 GB.10. The lightning to 3.5 mm adapter got lost. :( So I had to buy another one for Rs 900! The apple wired earphones sound very bad compared to my Sennheiser 275s. Next time I will buy a phone with a headphone jack.11. I tried using a wireless earphone. Problem is everytime I have to unpair it from one of my phones to connect to the other one. Then again, I have to unpair it from my phone to connect to my Mac. My PC doesn't have bluetooth so I have to use a wired headphone there. Also battery life drains very fast when I use bluetooth on my iPhone and now I have to keep charging my bluetooth headphone which has a micro USB cable. Great!. So I am carrying a Lightning cable, a USB type C cable for my android phone, a micro USB cable, a 3.5 mm headphone, USB type C to 3.5 mm (because I did not learn the lesson the first time) and a lightning to 3.5 mm headphone. Perfect!12. I am still happy with the performance of the phone though. Still no lag, feels like new.2019: Never going back to iPhone (most likely)1. I spent around Rs 200 every month on iCloud 50 GB and apple music every month. In a year I spent over Rs 2400/- I bought the battery case for Rs 5500/- and it has stopped working because the lightning adapter in the battery case stopped working. I bought a lightning to USB cable for 625/- and another one which did not work after a few days for 150/-. Taking into account screen protectors, cases, etc. I have spend almost Rs 10,000/- on things which were not factored into the cost of the phone. I am not including the bluetooth headset because I use it generally and is not specific for the phone.2. Apple has slowed down my phone or has done something to it as it is not as snappy as it was.3. The battery life is horrible. I went trekking a took a lot of pictures and in the morning it was 100% by 12 pm it was 5% and then it powered off. Of course I did not take continuous pictures. Around 100 or so pictures, and a couple of videos (totalling about ) 15 mins of videos.4.  My earpiece has stopped working and I have to almost shove the phone down my ear and so I use speakers for calls everytime. It will cost Rs 3500/- to fix.",iPhone 7

"In 2020 these big bezels are just unacceptable. It good iphone as provide at least a mid range choice, which is not super brittle.It has the latest tech from apple, but 32GB base? for a 30K phone. Only apple can have that atrocity to do that in 2020.Not a phone rightly place in 2020.",iPhone 7
"Dear friends,Apple iPhone is undoubtedly an overrated phone with lesser features than other reputed brands available for 1/3rd price.We use the phone for maximum 1-2 years & what's the point in buying an overpriced iPhone, when other reputed brands phones with much better features are available for 70% lesser price and has the same durability like an iPhone.It's just a hype they create by releasing new model iPhone once in 8 months to manipulate & tempt the foolish people to buy the new model by wasting their money by exchanging their previous model iPhone for very less price.Foolish people are making the clever company rich without thinking about the real plans of Apple (marketing gimmick & nothing special in quality, but highly priced).Please think well before spending your hard earned money on an iPhone.... Donate the same extra money you spend, to some needy people instead of wasting it by paying to a rich company like Apple.",iPhone 7
"he iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are deeply unusual devices. They are full of aggressive breaks from convention while wrapped in cases that look almost exactly like their two direct predecessors. Even that continuity of design is a break from convention; after almost a decade of Apple’s steady two-year iPhone update pattern, merely retaining the same design for a third straight year plays against expectations.Inside that case, everything else about the iPhone 7 is a decisive statement about the future. The dual cameras on the iPhone 7 Plus promise to usher in a new era in mobile photography. The iconic iPhone home button is no longer a physical button, but instead a sophisticated ballet of pressure sensors and haptic vibration motors that simulate the feel of a button. The new A10 Fusion processor blends two high-power cores that rival laptop performance with two low-power cores that combine with a much larger battery to extend run time by up to two hours.And, yes, Apple has removed the headphone jack.Removing the headphone jack is an act of pure confidence from Apple, which is the only company in tech that can set off a sea changes in the industry by aggressively dropping various technologies from its products. Floppy drives, optical drives, its own proprietary 30-pin iPod connector, flash, even USB — Apple decides that it’s time to move on, and it has a massive installed base of customers that love and trust the company who make it happen. And now it’s decided that — yikes — the headphone jack is over.After using the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus for about a week, it’s clear to me that Apple has forceful, but considered opinions about how the next generation of phones should fit into our lives. But it’s also clear that the iPhone 7 is a transitional step to that vision of the future, not a complete expression of it. The question for would-be upgraders is simple.",iPhone 7
There is no second thought.,iPhone 7
I was surprised to see there was no sealed packaging. There was a thin plastic cover over the white box and it didn’t require any cutting. I expected a sealed box inside but that wasn’t the case also. I had bought iPhone online earlier also and it required the plastic cover to be cut open.This makes me feel that I got an open box deal. Is it what I should have expected?,iPhone 7

"Hi everyone, after d usage f dis phone around 3 years m writing dis review. My opinion complete no for dis waste phone. Apart from show off u couldn’t do anything with it.1. Battery - Backup itself is ultra low dt u need to either plug to socket always or charge it for 2-3 times a day. At dis modern era dis phone is out f competition. Most f al when u r traveling dis battery power drops like anything, I don’t know y.2. Basic services like music , storage etc u have to pay monthly. When u can use almost all d services in android den it sucks to pay. Even u can’t set ua fav ringtone in a easy way. U can set but for dt u should follow hell lot of procedure.3. Charging n music usb are same - first f al its battery backup is so low and u can’t listen d music at dt time . What d hell .4. Overpriced- for dis small piece of shit.5. Not for professionals- couldn’t use Microsoft or some other mails.Conclusion: never go for  products , dey r just making d money by fooling d public.",iPhone 7
"trust me before this all i ever thought of iPhone and all I have ever used was a thick piece of metal which did some of what Android phones did.....except for 6s of course.....but this redefines what a mobile is and what it should do to make u happy....it gives u as much as you want in every possible way. A Punchy display, A clever crisp audio processor, an intelligent OS which can go toe to toe  with  Android in any day, splendid fingerprint reader, awesome camera(both front and back), the size might be one the wrong end for some people but trust me, this strikes a powerful blow in any top Android phone......Samsung S8 can be the Prince of All the phones but iPhone7  with their current  customization is definitely the King...(well iPhone 7 plus is the king of Kings so no point including that)Cons include a restriction with using either a charger or music cable at one point of time, which can be easily over come by using a bluetooth headphones,the ones coming from Samsung flagships will definitely feel a little bit let down by iPhone's display in the beginning.",iPhone 7

"This phone is very smooth. There is hardly any cons of having this phone except from the battery life which is very low.On a fully charged phone, if I have a 3 20 minutes calls each, the battery will go down from 100% to 60%Watching you-tube video will cause the battery to go down at the rate of 1% per every 2 minutes of the video.If you are one of the unlucky person who has to sit in-front of the laptop 9-10 hours a day, always recharging will not be problem.For mobile people, I would advice to buy a smart battery case.",iPhone 7

"Apple in India is worse than an average chinese mobile brand.If it works it may go on for years. But there is a 50% chance that you may need some assistance for some reason from their customer service. This is the catch.They are as bad as it gets. They talk about replacing the phone for every small reason. They have too many clauses for warranty.I went there to fix one minor issue. They took my phone and returned with two other issues and asked me to replace it by paying 28,350.I got it to work by getting it fixed by myself after realising the issue was just that the sim was getting stuck. So, I would had paid 28,350 for nothing had I listened to them.Never buy an apple product in India. It's too big of a risk despite of paying such hefty price.Regarding their customer service, don't believe me, just go to any local mobile repair shop and ask them how is it, they will laugh and tell you it's just a replacement centre not a service centre.",iPhone 7

Moving from iPhone 5 to 7 was absolutely no downer in terms of size, the size suited me well. Specifications wise - still exploring. ;)What's evidently different - the home button (the number 3 pressure press feels quite weird. Chose number 1 option) and yes of course the no-audio jack.

"I have bought my iPhone 7 32GB Matte black on 8th Oct just the day after the phone has been launched in India. I have been using it since almost a month. I bought it directly from apple store. And truly i would say, its an amazing device. My reviews are below.1. Great display, its has more color gamut than its previous versions.2. Great stereo speakers, as it has 2 speakers one at the head another at the bottom.3. The antenna band is only 5% visible in bare eyes, until & unless you minutely see it. So the design at the back side looks really clean and sturdy.4. Home button is no longer a physical button now, so it gives you haptik feedback whenever you give an amount of pressure to it. So the amount of pressure you apply decides what function it would invoke.5. The iSight camera now has OIS. So no flickering even if you are shooting while running.6. The touchID is much more faster than 6s. takes a bare minimum of 9-10s to create a touchID.7. A full charge of battery on heavy usage lasts a day. But if you are a moderate user it can last even more. And surprisingly it takes only 2 hours to charge it 100%.8. The Matte finishing on the back side is much more smoother and silkier than 6s. And believe me just go for Matte black if you are planning to buy it. The jet black version is a heck of fingerprint magnet, it takes a scratch even if your nails touches the back side. If you are going for a jet black version please buy a leather back cover before you open the plastic seal of the phone.9. Apple says the phone is splash resistant, but i have seen many of the vlogs the phone is actually water resistant upto 1 metre.10. The conversion of 3.5mm jack to reversible connector has improved the music quality even more.One important thing i would say to every apple user, please buy apple products directly from apple authorized sellers or re-sellers. You can buy it from Reliance Digital, E-Zone, Apple store. Don't buy apple products from online portals, as none of them are authorized by Apple. So if anything gets damaged to your apple device Apple service center doesn't accept the product. And this has happened with many a people.",iPhone 7

The new iPhone 7 has a huge upgrade in the camera department when compared to the 6 or 6s. The output from the speakers is very good thanks to the stereo speakers. Though it supports only a 1960 mAh battery the battery life is very good and. Can give one hour more screen on time than the 6s.. It can handle any game with ease and no lag. The general performance is top notch. The processor is the best and most powerful  processor.Cons :. The worst part is the absence of the 3.5 mm headphone jack.

The coolest mobile ever......... now I am a big fan of iphone......,iPhone 7
"Apple iPhone is 100% value for money. It is just people don't realise or they don't need those features they just buy for the logo .  I tried 25 phones in the last 3 yrs and finally settled for iPhone . So far if u want to go for performance in mid  range go for Moto  Mobiles but their camera and audio quality on earphones sucks . If u want to go for looks display and camera Samsung is best but only fault is earphone volume . If u r traveling in train or bus , the earphone volume is not enough while watching videos . Finally all these shortcoming overcome by apple . The biggest advantage of iPhone is their OS which gets update every year , its simplicity of OS , its processor which is miles ahead of any android processor like 6s which is 2 yrs old  can easily beat Galaxy s8 processor .  Few things like connecting to a bluetoth speaker most phone cant control volume of Bluetooth speaker precisely only iPhone does . The. Reason is simple its OS is same for the last 10 yrs I mean the basic functionality and it is the only company which has complete control over their OS . In android its mixture of Google and other company software like miui or Samsung software which make things messy . I know all these things doesn't matter to a normal consumer but that doesn't make iPhone a waste of money . It is always worth if u buy an iPhone . Its value doesn't decrease as rapidly as other phones .",iPhone 7
"Came to this phone after selling my Google Pixel XL, which was a great phone on its own, but wanted to see what the fuss is about iOS and Apple's better app ecosystem and all that. My main comparison of this phone will remain with the Pixel.Positives first:- Top class build quality. The phone looks solid, feels solid. Finishing of the product is top notch.- Taptic Engine. Vibration motor of a phone is a hugely important thing and this phone has the best vibration I have ever experienced. No Android flagship phone I have used has anywhere near the intensity or quality. Reminds me of the olden days of them Nokia phones with huge vibration motor inside them. Great job there hands down.- Camera is good. In low light especially. Noise are kept well in control. Overall the camera can't beat Pixel, can't beat a lot of other phones anyway, but its a good camera, especially for someone who used to use DLSRs for long time to appreciate natural, less saturated output. And video quality is tremendously good.Though the front camera is awful. I almost never use it, but coming from a Pixel it felt like having a VGA front camera.- Fingerprint reader is in the best position in front, and it works every time.- Smoothness. Well smoothness is good. Definitely much less frame drops overall across the UI than Pixel, but not to an extent where it could make significant difference anyway.- RAM Management. Excellent. For a phone having 2 gigs of RAM, well I can only laugh at Android. Where Pixel reloaded apps with double RAM, this thing can apps in memory.- Battery life. Very good. For a tiny sized battery, I am getting 6-7 hours of SoT with 24 hours of standby time.- RAW Speed. Needless to say anything about the A10 chipset. It chews graphically demanding games and apps like nothing. There simply is no Android phone which can come anywhere close.Now the Negatives, which outdo the positives for my usage:- Most impractical and unintuitive OS I have ever experienced. The scrolling mechanism is stupid. You can't scroll fast up or down, it will stuck at a point, so you will get tired. And it misses some touches in the process to. Waste of time. Free flow scrolling for life.Then there is no system wide BACK option. This will drive you bonkers if you are coming from android. Every app is different, where most apps do have the gesture support of left to right to go back to previous screen, its still nowhere near as fast as simply hitting a back button. And on some apps there simply is no gesture support, like Paytm for example. And the back button is located on TOP LEFT corner, which you can't reach with one hand, and I am using the smaller version of the phone. You can touch the home button twice to activate a reduced sized display of current screen, but it goes away as soon as you do something which requires to move to another screen. Ridiculous beyond explanation.Also there is no share option to other apps like Snapseed or Drive or Google Photos directly from the native Photos app! Another time wasting thing!There is no T9 support on the native dialler. ROFL.- Call quality. I don't know but I just don't like the call quality, especially when I am coming from a phone which had brilliant call quality.- SAR value! Don't know how it could be that absurdly high! Check GSMArena specs! Scary really!- No fast charging. This simply should be here. Even this smaller battery takes full two hours to charge fully, LoL.That's it basically. When this phone works for a lot of people, who think that this phone is miles ahead in terms of whatever, probably for the fruit logo at back side, this was simply not for me. Absolutely ridiculous amount of time I wasted trying to do simple things. I never did care about the Apple logo, God knows which type of people care about that, so for me, I need something which is much more practical, much more intuitive, and which won't drive me bonkers for simple stuffs, so yeah that was Apple for me.Best of luck.Regards,Saurav",iPhone 7
"I bought this product from local Apple authorised store and this is what I feel after using it for almost 15 days now.They say it has superior hardware like better processor,camera and battery life with additional features like waterproof and dust proof compared to IPhone 6s. Practically it makes no differerence at all except for camera. Any application you run in iPhone 7 and IPhone 6s takes same time and also same time to copy files etc. What is the meaning of superior hardware if it makes no difference compared to its predecessors?This hardware etc. is just selling point of this phone as its battery life is same as IPhone 6s too.If you are upgrading from iPhone 5s or 6 to Iphone 7 then it could be worth but if you are upgrading from 6s then it is completely waste of money. For IPhone 6s/plus users I say wait for Iphone 7s.",iPhone 7
Bought iPhone on 5th May. The Price got reduced 4000 rupees less than a week. I am Very much disappointed.,iPhone 7
"Great phone. The performance and looks are mind blowing. The only drawback is that it does not have a 3.5 mm audio jack, so you need to carry a usb type-C to 3.5 mm otg adapter to listen to songs on eraphones.",iPhone 7
"I have used a s7 edge before I bought a iPhone from local dealer,I was very impressed by audio quality in s7 and have heard Samsung put a lucky chip for audio which improved the sound wearing headfones very much better than s6.After listening to my music on iPhone 7 I found it outclassed all Samsung flagship models especially when listening  to music over iphone speakersworld,if picture colour  accuracy is what u like iPhone is the one for you",iPhone 7

I did not think about it is a good decision in buying the I phone 7 in May-2020Camera quality is little bit better than in 6sSound clarity is goodcharging little faster than 6s & Battery life is also better.Only difference is audio jack.Cons;Battery life is still an issue in I phone.No facility to expand the memory.Better to add one plastic case/cover for protection,  like the other mobile like oppo.Many apps are available in google store but not available in app store.Overall I am happy with the phone.",iPhone 7
"Please do not buy expensive product like iphone from Amazon, i had very bad exp, the charger cord was missing and had sound quality issues. Amazon initial told charger doesn't come in box and when i challenged it they asked reimburse the cord amount, but i requested a replacement, after some days they called me and informed that they dont take responsibility of missing items, and 10 day replacement policy they dont follow, you can read the email conversation attached  here where i mentioned every thing, i have the call recordings as well. At last they denied the phone replacement and even to provide the missing cord. For any damage or quality issues they said amazon is not responsible.",iPhone 11
"Bought the mobile from appario retail ltd. Mobile is heating up within seconds and also camera modes aren’t working properly. Particularly in portrait mode, the stage light and mono options aren’t working properly.  i raised the same to apple customer care they confirmed that its not software issue. But the amazon customer care told me that they need a job card and report from apple service center. The nearest service center is located at 210km from my place, imagine the amount of strain and how much its going to cost. Before you buy anything from this seller just google it and u can find numerous complaints on this seller. What ever they sell u will find defective products only.

"My Phone is Producing Too Much Heat Even Didn’t Put Sim , Never used more than Half an hour And It’s producing too much heat.. Totally Disappointed With Amazon.

No one would like to repair new phone 😢 Better Go for shop To buy apple products .",iPhone 11
"The iPhone design is good and the camera quality is awesome. You can also take pictures in wide angles and the image quality is awesome.Phone got delivered at 9am on 28th September (I pre-order it on 27th September at 3am in the morning), I got my phone before the delivery date with nice and secured packaging.The overall look of the phone is premium and face unlocking is fast. I grabbed this phone with HDFC 6K Instant Discount Offer at Just 64K (128 GB Variant).Cons:1. The phone is great but if you use ""in the box"" accessories like ""EarPods with Lighting Connector"", then you might feel a little pain in your ears.2. The phone comes with 5W charger which charge your phone slowly. I recommend you to prefer using 18W charger.Well, I've never tried the iPhone before and I'm using this for the first time (Yes, I'm already using other apple products like MacBook Air & Pro).But the product is great and I'm just lovin it.",iPhone 11
This is a big scam. I received the iphone 11 yesterday and it turned out to be a defective piece . The audio doesn’t record when you are recording a video. Multiple other issues like phone not turning on even after being on full charge . So it says 10 days replacement on this. So I clicked on it and Amazon says we can’t do anything you should contact Apple . Apple says our service Centers are not having any slots so we can’t do anything you should contact amazon . What is this ? You torture a customer as soon as you make money . And that too for such en expensive phone . I demand a replacement for my phone right now Amazon ! Don’t play with people’s hard earned money . Guys stay away from this Apple days sale .,iPhone 11
"Defective product,got heat up within 5 minutes of starting. Need to return  fastVery very bad experience",iPhone 11
The product i got was defective . The face id is not working and the back camera is also not working. There is a lot of hassle to get it exchanged. The apple service centre is also not of much help as the product is from amazon. Please buy phones from apple store to get the right product .,iPhone 11
"Just after i switched it on, it started producing so much heating even i cant hold it by hand. Later i tried YouTube, game, normal browsing and it has the same excessive heating issue.

I am very furious because i thought its an apple product and product will be robust.  My first impression on apple products is worst becuase of online reseller.This online reseller dont send the correct product instead they will send defective pieces or old piesces.My loss is 60000 rs. These people are worst and i request other guys not to take apple products from online or from the above mentioned reseller.",iPhone 11

[No, I have not put any additional back panels fyi].After spending 60K+ and seeing this kind of heating issue is completely unacceptable from a brand like Apple. I have approached Apple care [Service Request No: SKC4616] and they said they have to send the device to Bangalore  for further diagnosis. When I called just before writing this review, they are quoting they are not working today due to Sunday they are closed and blah blah...Apple wake up.

"This being my second Apple device. No, I haven't sold my kidney as I got this for about 58K. I have been an avid Android Fanboy using 1+ as my daily driver for the past 5 years. The switch using move to iOS and the entire transition using Drive, Photos etc.. It has been seamless. I may miss a thing or two about 1+ with what a stock Android would offer. Couple of my colleagues argued how good the latest 1+ phones are. Two things that 1+ will never be good at. Photography and Intermittent lag. Yes, a phone with 12 Gigs of ram lags!Now, off to the device.ProsThe device's build quality is amazing. The detail given in to every tiny little thing should be noted. Even the Sim tray is made out of metal.Speakers sound better than my previous phone.A couple of you might argue about LCD with lower resolution on the device. I certainly cannot differentiate that though. Color blind maybe!OS - There's no other mobile OS that is this speedy, updated on time basis and supports device for 5 long years. Yeah, you can root your phone and rock new Lineage OS on your Droid but the circumstances of rooting, Magisk cannot help Banking apps work.Camera - There are no other camera phones that are this good. Night mode is amazing. Such low light pictures turn out be so good. Note Huawei phones no longer have Google services yes you can sideload Play Store but that's still pain the arse. Next Pixel isn't going to be cheap either.ConsRemember an iPhone is always treated as an asset than a phone. Ask someone who has dropped his or her phone on a hard surface and the pain that it takes to have it repaired or replaced.Couple of them have pointed out that the device is a bit thick. Yes it is. Honestly slim phones cannot have more juice within. You have to sacrifice either of them.No 3.5MM means you can't charge and listen to music i.e. move on to wireless headphones.Overall an amazing phone that's worth every penny. And a phone that I'd be using for the next 5 years for sure just like my 1+ One The Legend. Electronic goods are always depreciating unlike Gold or Land and fits the needs of checking messages and making calls is all you need.",iPhone 11

"This will help you more. See if you are planning to buy iPhone 11. I will say.

You guys have more or less better gadget.2) If you are an android user and planning to buy premium phone. I will suggest them to please buy iPhone instead of buying an Android. I bet you will never go back to android after using IOS.Now I want to share my 2 month experience with iPhone 11.1) Battery backup is 19 hours as I used it for 1 week.2) Mind blowing Camera. Best is slow motion.3) Very Handy. And look premium. If you have huge money then please go for Pro max.4) Display is more or less good. Worth it because it is not Premium display and you are not paying for 11 Pro max.5) You will love the sound when your phone is ringing.6) Front camera is awesome and must try slow motion selfie.

There is a minor Scratch to the glass on the front end it’s only visible when viewed in light properly it seems like a thread from cloth also when you touch that area nothing is felt . Is exchange of the item possible ?

It would be great if exchange is made possible coz at the end of the day so much money is put into it .

"I bought the iPhone 11 64gb red and I absolutely love it. The design is insanely good.Lot of reviews say that they received a damaged phone but that is simply not true!!The truth is the phone comes with an outdated iOS and you must update it. Or else your camera won’t be running normally or the video quality won’t be more than 360p( as it was in my case). But once you do a software update, all the bugs gets fixed.Also a lot of them seem to say that the phone gets overheated. I thought mine was getting overheated too. But there’a a difference between it being warm and overheating. The truth is it gets warm if you do intense processing. ( The software update took care of that too and I don’t know how).So don’t worry about buying a iPhone here. A lot of them are freaking out that their phones aren’t functioning properly and they were too quick to write a bad review. Truth is a software update fixes all these people’s complaints.",iPhone 11
"The iphone 11 is a good phone every thing is fine but in this budget all the phones are better than it. The main problem is the battery it is long if you dont play any games , if you use the phone for using social media and camera you can go for it .But ya another problem is the refresh rate if you dont know refresh rate it is screen smoothness . it has 60 hz of refresh rate and all the phones in budget have 120 hz to 144 hz .

"Dont go by the negative reviews! If you want to go for iphone which can compete with high end android phones, this is the one. I have used the Oneplus 7T for 2.5 months (and sold it) and can say after comparison that the photos that iPhone 11 takes are way better than OP 7T. The battery has been performing really well after all daily chores, youtube, spotify, netflix, etc. I have last charged the phone to 100% at 9.12 pm and as I write this review (12.54 pm next day), I have got 30% left. I used to have an iphone 6s which I used for 4 years after which I bought the OP 7T. Now that I am back to the ios ecosystem, it does feel good! Also, trust me, the transition back to a Liquid Retina display from 90Hz does not feel bad, because Apple has really done a good job is maintaining a crisp and vibrant display in iPhone 11. Go for it guys. Haters will always hate!",iPhone 11

"My mom got this phone after using oneplus 5t for 2 years and for change she wanted to try iOS. As she is not a heavy user and not a pixel peeper and also inclines towards fancy colored phones[previously lava red 5t] I thought of advising her to go for iPhone 11. Now coming to the phone or should I say iPhone, it is really a good one fulfilling many of its duties; I'll just list out a few points regarding the phone:Pros:A great camera with realistic colors[not highly saturated]The best video recording on a mobile[as of Feb 2020]Somewhere between great to excellent battery lifeThe software experience is great if you're into ""apple way"" of things and the whole experience is just FLUIDICThe phone feels expensive and gives you a feel-good factor and also the build is pretty stellar even if some people are commenting that it's sides are alluminium and not steel.Cons:Many buyers and even youtubers are saying that the display is great and you wont notice the difference in day to day life but I dont want to sugarcoat things! The display is DECENT and NOT great! In day to day life with texting applications and general usage of phone you wont feel any difference, that is correct, BUT when you get into media apps like youtube, NETFLIX, ... etc you will notice the difference of lower resolution. there's just no escaping that fact.You will also notice a great difference in screenshots containing text.The display, in my opinion, would be the main deal breaker for me but in my case the phone is for my mom and she's not a tech geek and she's loving the purple color and the camera of the phone.And also if you're into data transferring between your phone and your laptop[windows laptop] this phone will frustrate you for sure. For this I will suggest you to rely on cloud based services and not on manual cable sync process.Conclusion with personal thoughts:Overall the phone is a great one if you're not a tech geek and want the latest iPhone. It's also a great pick for those who want great hardware with flagship tech but prefer watching media on laptop or smart TV.",iPhone 11
"Beware of Amazon and the seller Appario Retail Private Ltd. Never purchase high end phones from online platform.

To my surprise, the service centre denied stating they never issue letters, other than the service record sheet. Still waiting for Amazon to process the exchange of iPhone 11.Horrible experience with #Amazon. 😭Rating of 1 star is for Amazon and the seller and not for the phone.

"Received Defective, Screen Bleeding Issue",iPhone 11
Happy Fillings,iPhone 11
"Been almost 10 months I have been using the iPhone 11 128 GB. Apple is known as one of the premium phone manufacturers who do not compromise on quality, user experience and simplicity (company claims). It is certain that the Apple products have a brand appeal in the Indian market. This appeal allows them to charge a surplus from the customers for their products. Opinions differ if this is justified. For me, I like to evaluate the phone’s features with the cost.The build quality And design of this phone is absolutely fantastic! Curves at the right places, the tactile buttons, it just screams premium. When you pick up the phone, you feet the weight. I came into this phone from a Samsung galaxy and the first thing I notice is the disparity in the weight. This is probably due to the LCD screen on the former as compared to OLED in the galaxy series. The screen on Iphone 11is a “Liquid Retina display”; fancy term for a highly polished, well optimised LCD screen. It is a good screen. It is just slightly above 720p resolution but in everyday activities most people won’t notice it. I noticed it. For me, the screen is a major downside of this phone. You are shelling out almost 70000 ₹, the customer deserves at least a 1080p (full HD) screen. Today when most of the “budget” phones come with 1080p screen, the step back by Apple is definitely not appreciated. It is also necessary to mention, I prefer OLED screen over LCD due to their deep blacks and high contrast ratio. But surprisingly, this LCD screen on the iPhone is better than a few OLED screens I compared it to!(albeit comparing at the same resolution)- Xaomi note series, vivo and oppo. Only Samsung screens were ridiculously amazing even in their M series phones.Another positive of iPhone is the amazing battery life. I am a very heavy user with lots of videos, streaming music all the time, Bluetooth on, WiFi on, location on, browsing, multiple calls daily, video conference meetings, push email- official and personal, light browsing on social media sites and a lot of photos/videos. This beast survives the whole day! But the thing that irks me is the puny 5 watt charger in the box. It takes close to 3 h to charge from 10% to 96%! I suggest you buy a 12 watt charger that is sold separately. Apple should have provided a 12 watt charger in the box at the price point.Another frustrating part of the Apple ecosystem is the iCloud storage that essentially is required if you want to back up phone/photos etc. this costs 79₹ for 50GB PER MONTH. Apple pulls you into their ecosystem with their services, which I must say are excellent. The Apple ecosystem is stress free and just seamless. The phrase “it just works” really works here. I have an MacBook Pro and the iPhone works really well with my laptop allowing me to answer calls, messages right from my laptop.The one feature I wasn’t too sure of, which grew on me until the start of pandemic, is the face recognition. It’s safe, secure and absolutely amazing. It works for all authentication requirements of the phone and is beautiful. I understand now the appeal of face recognition and the “soli” chip on the google pixel4. Btw, the pandemic and the accompanying masks have created a hurdle for the face recognition. Today I wonder if the fingerprint would have been better than the fancy face recognition.One of my favourite is the cameras! It’s Apple! They made their name and reputation on cameras. I won’t say too much on this topic as it’s well known. Only google pixel can compete in the photos department but they iPhone is definitely the video kings.Another key area in which Apple has made their name is the security, encryption and privacy policy. This is one of the major reasons for their premium price tags.I give this phone a very enthusiastic 4 stars. I wish they improve the screen at this price point to at least a 1080p and include a respectable charger in the box. I have not talked about the OS as I believe iOS or android is a personal choice and I am reviewing the key features of the iPhone and it’s hardware.",iPhone 11
"Phenomenal is the word , apple finally clicks in India with its predatory pricing and top notch feature which makes it hard to let go.The battery is running strong and the added extra camera is a plus. Apple you aced this one.",iPhone 11
MRP on product is 69k for 128gb variant but Amazon is selling for 73.6k saying revised price after April’2020. Is this justified?Also I have opted for 6 months no cost emi but when I see my credit card statement entire amount is due. Amazon now claiming that I have not opted for any emi option and asking me whether I took any screenshot while making payment. Such an unprofessional behaviourNow come to the phone-Everything is awesome except whenever you make call or incoming calls the network for that number dies and quality of call is terrible . I am using it as dual sim and not sure if it bcoz of this.Battery also taking too much time to get chargedMobile is heating after half an hour of use,iPhone 11
This is phone is amazing!Face ID : responsive and super save!!Camera: It’s the best feature of this phone! Really good camera.Display: it’s still good! When compared to a one plus 7 and 8.

"After 3 years with iPhone 7 I finally decided to take an upgrade to iPhone 11, and I must say, that it’s totally a value for money! Have been using it continuously since morning, it’s been 5-6 hours of usage and the battery has come down from 100 to 75% only!If you’re looking for a high end and value for money smartphone, this is it!There are a few bugs however, but they’re iOS bugs which’ll be sorted soon I’m sure with upcoming updates!",iPhone 11
"Ordered for iPhone 11 and received the very next day. When tried to switch on the phone, it did not work. Tried out it on charge and figured it had 0% battery charge! Normally it happens when there is a problem with battery or the phone which drains out charge even though it's switched off! Immediately notified Amazon and demanded refund/ replacement! Then we figured you can't get refund for Apple products on Amazon. However if the product is faulty, they will try fixing it or replace. Have not set up the phone yet as people suggested not to do that, else there may be further trouble returning the product. Confusing suggestions from customer care team, technical team etc. Suggestions: Never ever buy premium products, specially Apple products on Amazon. Will put together the whole experience once we know what's happening and share details.",iPhone 11
"Not rating right now.But i want to make one thing clear. I ordered the device on sale, from delhi, seller: appario.The device is genuine. Authentic with one year warranty.One week+ , review: the phone is working as expected. Apple devices,i believe, are not for hard usage and i bought this to put some restrictions on myself. Will update again after some time.I saw people writing negative reviews about appario so i felt fear that i made a mistake.. but then last year my friend ordered XR on sale during october like i did this year..He said that people who are happy with thier product are less likely to write a feedback and those who do not get as promised are the once who lash out which is fair.So here i am writing this.First two days reviewBattery life okCamera natural light good, artificial good (artificial zoom avg)Face id goodInterface once u get everything its hard to not track everythingRest everything is typical appleConPhone is heavy hahahaIll try to keep updating..",iPhone 11

"got the phone delivered within a day . Excellent service. But I guess the responsibility ends there itself.  the product is faulty .  Screen flickers ,  touch screen becomes un-responsive,  screen black out for a  few seconds is common and above all the  iphone heats  up horribly  to an extent that it made me uncomfortable holding the phone.  having read on  google now, it seems the product is faulty and heating is a common problem.  Fed up of liaising with Apple  & Amazon . hoping it will be replaced",iPhone 11
"Actually, I ordered the phone (on 2 July) without checking the reviews, as I believed in the Apple quality and Amazon delivery (I am using iPhone since 2012). Later, when I checked the negative comments (around 15% of overall comments), I was bit worried, as all people commented saying they faced heating issues/camera problem/audio and sound issues. However, I received my mobile yesterday (7 July), fortunately everything is good. I will update my review, if I encounter any aforementioned problems in the future.I gave 4 stars instead of 5 as I had a lot of problem while exchanging my older phone. The delivery was initially scheduled on 6 July, the delivery guy was uneducated and didn't know the exchange process, I wasted my 4 hours for this process on that day. Finally, on 7 July the new delivery guy came and resolved the process.",iPhone 11
"From the last 3 months, i was waiting for the best possible phone in every aspect. I got to know about iphone 11 being one of the best selling apple products. Watched lots of videos on youtube related to unboxing, reviews. Especially i was looking for cons rather than pros. I got to know that the display not being oled is not that good. Then i compared it with iphone 11 pro and i got to know that build and display is only better in pro model, except that everything is same. I came to a decision of buying the iphone 11 and purchased it on prime day sale on 62k with discounts. From the last 3 weeks have been using iphone 11 as my primary phone and i can say it has been the best decision of my life. ios is buttery smooth, its 120hz touch response rate gives you a 90hz refresh rate feeling. No lag whatsoever. Ram management is superb. Sound quality is topline having that loud stereo speakers. Though i can say the speakers are not as loud as what i had seen in asus rog 3(being a reviewer on youtube) i get review units. Next the battery life is as good as a 5000mah android phone. It can easily last for a day and a half with moderate usage including gaming. The display might be not that vibrant and saturated like oled panels but its super bright and the blacks are much richer than what you see on other lcd panels(afterall its apple, you get what you pay). Finally the camera makes you feel like so great. The photos might not look that good in phone but transfer it to your pc, you will see the clarity of the camera. Video quality is superb. So overall a must buy if you are planning to invest in a phone which can last for the upcoming 5yrs. Hope my review helps ppl still deciding whether to buy iphone 11 or not.",iPhone 11
"Awesome phone!! Specially if you’re upgrading from an older iphone! Absolute value for money! You get the best camera on any phone, best battery life with the fastest iphone processor at a very reasonable price (in iphone standards). There is absolutely no reason to not buy this phone!",iPhone 11
"Camera is too good, smooth touch, fantastic sound quality, fantastic look, and performance is too good",iPhone 11
Firstly thanks to amazon for delivering product safely and on time. I was looking to upgrade my iphone x was using it since 2018 was very much satisfied with it. And since iphone 11 was launched was very much confused wether I should buy pro series or else should stick with 6.1 inch line up people was sharing their thoughts that it's just an xr update with 2 dual camera. Which was confusing decision for me but I made my mind and got iphone 11 and I am really happy with my decision it saved my 50k for it's a paisawasool product for just one more camera and oled display it's not worth to spend that huge amount.Pros:-•Wide angle camera•Supports fast Charing•Stunning looks•Superb Camera quality•Safe and secure device •Flagship A13 Bionic ChipCons:-•The worst slow charger which apple still provide us 5w @1amp•Still have huge notch•Bit costly in India,iPhone 11
You won’t regret it If you buy it .Camera quality is awesome and performance of this phone is next level. Lucky to have this phone in pocket,iPhone 11
"Too new to rate. Some of the recent reviews were extremely scary for an Apple product and unfortunate that those customers were given bad products. Took a risk, ordered and told to cancel but Amazon force delivered the product. Opened and checked for defects, none so far.  Made in India, product is authentic! Thankfully not a refurbished phone. Verified the warranty, started using, so far so good. Will try update review periodically for your benefit.",iPhone 11

"The touch is intermittent...sometimes great... sometimes doesn’t respond. Heavy. Network receiver not working properly. What else to say... feeling cheated....After one month.....Now it’s been over a month since I have been using it and I feel that it’s the worst product from Apple. I don’t know what’s the reason but even after two updates, I feel that the touch is not working well and it keeps hanging on. The camera is not very wow but works well (looking at the price it’s not something really great...this much is expected at least). Also, the Face ID doesn’t work most of the times. And it takes more than 5 seconds to realise that it now needs to show up the regular pin/pattern to unlock. Even otherwise, I personally don’t find Face ID to be successful. To be true my four year old nephew finds it really easy to open this as he would keep my phone ready to capture my attention and would say something that would lead me to look at the phone unknowingly.",iPhone 11

This isnt bad as pubg is a demanding game and running it on max setting is a very good deal.On the privacy side also apple is remarkable with its face id and permission mechanism.Every app is also 100x better than its counterpart in android as its very well optimised.Really awesome phone and i highly recommend if u want a phone urgently.or u can wait till iphone 12 :D.And Jus for a note..this last year flagship can throw the samsung s20 ultra and run circles around it on the performace level.",iPhone 11

"Alright, this review is going to be a little long so hear me out.First things first. Delivery was on time and the seller provided us with a genuine product. So thumbs up 👍  for that.Let me talk a little about the phone 📱. Out of all its siblings, this was one is the most reasonable one.✅ It has the A13 Bionic processor meaning it is one of the best in the smartphone industry.✅ All-day battery life.✅ A great degree of water & dust resistance.✅ Wireless charging✅ An extra ultra-wide camera✅ An extra SIM via eSIM (Only Jio & Airtel provide this for now)✅ The excellent iOS support that is guaranteed for years to come so you never miss out on the new and exciting software features.But confused about getting the iPhone 11 Pro and Max version? Well, you will be paying a lot more for the AMOLED screen and the extra lens camera. Otherwise, the phones are nearly identical.A high recommendation for this product.",iPhone 11

"Keeping the review of the item aside. Never buy any costly items on the ecomm sites.Detail Explanation of problems faced:I bought the iPhone 11 128GB Black during Amazon big billion days happened between 16 Oct 2020 to 22 Oct 2020. Orderd on 16 Oct 2020 and it got delived on 18 Oct 2020. As like other recent news like fake products. Thank god that i didnt got any fake product/cloned product. When i got the phone and connected to wifi, it asked for the ios14 update. During the update process itself phone hanged and it didnt respond. Left it overnight so that it could complete so by morning mobile was dead. I had switched on the mobile by keeping in charging. 1 day it worked fine and very next day.. there is no network, and a pop-up message stating ""you can't make calls/send messages or use mobile data untill phone get updated"". In Phone update there is no suggestions and already showing ur phone is updated. By restarting the phone the network came back. So left it. Again next day morning situation repeats. Now my mbl is with Apple service provider as they find fault in the device and sent to Apple. Not even 3 days i had my new phone which i bought for 54000/- left at the service centre.",iPhone 11
It’s just beautiful. The iOS is so fluid and smooth. No lags whatsoever. Camera takes awesome pics. The best part is the battery. It easily lasts 1 day and maybe more with fairly intensive use. I am moving from Android to IOS and I already know that I am never ever going back to Android again. The phone feels solid and sturdy in the hand.I don’t have any negatives to write about even though I really thought about writing some because a review is never fair without writing pros and cons. Go for it with eyes closed and you won’t go wrong. Go for a 128 Gigs. You will definitely need it.,iPhone 11
"the seller appario retail ltd. gives old used and defective pieces. and if you go to get replacement they(apple) dont entertain you becoz you got it from amazon. you should get apple products from apple.com . they are 4-5k costlier but atleast you know for sure that the product is new and not defective. and even when you hah\ve any issue, you can contact apple and they will help you. but if you buy from amazon, very high probability that you might get defective piece from this seller and apple wont help you much.",iPhone 11

"I am a first time and new iphone user after decades of Android ownership - Blackberry and OnePlus 3 this past decade. One of the main reasons for buying the iphone 11 was price came down during independence day sale week!This is why I decided against a new OnePlus:1. Ear piece on the phone is extremely poor even with calls on speaker.2. Camera is beyond awful. Problems 1 and 2 could not be resolved even after giving piece to OnePlus dealer.3. In the 4th year, weird things started happening - calls without showing caller, youtube plays without volume, calls with caller Id but with no volume, among other problems.That said, user interface and general phone speed were good and reception was decent. As I'm planning a Mac, decided to get iphone and based on reviews, decided to get 11 instead of X or SE primarily because of A13.I'm a regular user and am not active on social media and don't use phone for gaming either. Uses are - calls and basic browsing. As I'm working from home, don't even use it for Amazon, Netflix etc which I see on TV. So, based on this usage, here's my one-week review.First, I was apprehensive on what Apple sells with the phone so I even bought a wireless charger (https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B085W5BQ5H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and Basics ear phone. Thankfully, iphone 11 comes with charger and earphones.Appearance of 11 - given my usage etc., I don't particularly care for looks of any phone - as long as ergonomically convenient, I'm fine. The phone feels lighter than my OnePLus 3 and even Samsung M21. Sleek and looks good. However, I would recommend red colour if you don't mind it - black is a little staid and anyway you use covers for phones.User interface - I didn't have any problem with OnePlus and so far, Apple seems to be fine. sufficient speed in opening and closing apps and easy to navigate. I just figured how to toggle screens - it's a little tougher than on Android phones, but I guess you will figure it out.Camera - compared to OnePlus - AWESOME. incredibly sharp, the night camera is awesome and it's got panorama as well.Speaker - AWESOME. given my problem with One Plus, this is awesome.Charger and battery - stock charger is decent - but it does take about 2 hours to charge from 20%. Battery life lasts easily 24+ hours. But then my usage is also minimal - right now I'm charging once in 2 days. Wireless charging (RAEGR Arc 400) is quite slow. the OnePlus was amazing in this area and fast charge is missed.earphones - Thankfully iphone 11 uses charger jack for earphones. the stock ear phone is decent - fits snugly and has decent wire length and audio is decent. the Amazon basics one is also decent.Overall user experience:Pros - a good overall experience and barring minor points stated below, i'm happy with the iphone 11.Downloading and installation of Apps - straghtforward and decent.Call signal quality etc. - quite good, no complaints.Don’t worry about Face ID it works well in the dark as well. If it doesn’t you just need to use your passcode so it isn’t bad. For the most part it’s quit consistent. Keyboard experience more or less similar to android so nothing different there either.Cons - 1. it appears that phone numbers can't be copy-pasted from internet to dial pad - and it's a pain.2. screen/mirror casting isn't working on a Croma TV as easily or sometimes at all.3. easy of navigation between Chrome Windows on Google isn't as easy as on Android - you can easily move back and forth between tabs opened on Google - can't do that that easily here.One other point - transfer of data from Android to iphone was hardly a problem - the iphone takes you through the process. Data gets backed up to your iCloud and you can access it and deal with it.Hope this review helps next buyer.",iPhone 11
"The Battery cannot hold up for long, also let me point the very obvious 18W charger getting a miss from the box and still isn’t up to the current Unix-Linux run, Google Android OS phones like Samsung’s A 30’s which cost about 12-15k come with 15W chargers..Camera: Night Mode is only useful if there is some kind of light it just can’t help but over expose the pictures and make them fee like they are from a Feature phone in the early years.Sound & Call Quality also NetworkSound is spot on both the music and audio or video calls are crystal clear.. I must add the front firing speaker was a great addition but what will make it more interesting will be if they can make the other vent for just acoustics into a speaker and have three instead of a dummy vent!Network with any kind of case on will have issues of poor and unstable connection.Camera:The Live Photo’s with the new hardware module just works superb with decent lighting. It wouldn’t take you more than a couple of seconds to figure out what should be your frame with the sensor throughly doing its job picking up subjects, colors, shadows and adding the Apple magic in every photo :PI would’ve preferred an Apple insurance or any warranty extension, we are all aware how the exchange and sale value on these phones are like lately!",iPhone 11
"The iPhone 11 delivered was defective and had spots on display which doesn't clear even after cleaning. Amazon app shows 10 days return or replacement by Amazon. But, when contacted they push us to go to apple service center directly and doesn't provide any help.",iPhone 11

"Worst purchase for such huge amount that was spent. Camera quality is very poor, my galaxy s9 plus is much better than this one. Amazon doesn’t accept return but the options in the app shows return applicable. iPhone claims to have best camera and has large hoardings everywhere but in reality it’s not.Totally regret on this purchase.",iPhone 11
"This is my first iPhone. After being an Android enthusiast and loyalist for over a decade, poor Pixel design and besting camera of iPhone 11 made me switch to the walled garden. Coming from Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge I had my doubts on the LCD screen and low resolution, but believe me my doubts were unfounded. The screen on iPhone 11 is crisp and clear, with good color accuracy and balanced punch. I did a lot research comparing iPhone 11, the pro and max models as well, along with Note 10 and OnePlus 7T Pro. Comparing them side by side, iPhone 11 always came out on top in camera department - the most important criteria for me (which had made me choose S7 years ago). I also looked at iPhone XR, but the 11 offers substantial updates over XR.-----------------------************------------------------Here are the pros from the last few days of usage:1) Excellent battery life - I consistently end my day at 40+ %. All while I am still exploring the phone (and hence using it more).2) Dual camera system - the normal iPhone 11 makes the perfect compromise from the pro models - retaining the same primary sensor and wide angle sensor - I can live without the telephoto. Essentially the same quality as the pro. Pictures are true to life, accurate in color and great HDR. Low light performance is again top notch.3) A13 bionic and butter smooth experience. Never experienced lag free ui before - even 12GB RAM model Note 10 stuttered when testing.4) Promise of timely updates, straight from Apple. No OEM BS. This is an underrated and misunderstood parameter. I am paying comparable money for Android phones and getting latest OS after 6+ months and that too for only 2 years (followed by 1 year of security updates). Apple's promise of 5 year updates is reassuring - with increasing use of financial transactions on mobile getting security releases and bug fixes on day of release is critical.5) Build quality and design are unparalleled. Love the design - grows on you. Apple is a premium brand and you can feel the attention to detail in alignment of ports, ui elements, the milled camera cutout, etc.6) Gestures - Android does a piss poor job of this. Samsung's dumb implementation on Note 10 killed it for me. I don't need a split pill for the sake of it and call it Gestures. iOS does it so much better and in an intuitive style. I wonder how I was using my phone in now what feels like an archaic way through back button (and pixel's implementation is pathetic and confusing).7) Face ID is way more convenient that fingerprint and security unmatched on Android. I don't need to fiddle any more with my fingers to unlock and then navigate the phone. Seems Face ID and Gesture navigation complement each other to make a powerful and smooth user experience. I can navigate the phone instantly so my hands dont need to first fiddle with a fingerprint scanner and then shift the hold and focus to navigation. It's these small things that makes Apple what it is - a pleasurable experience.------------------------***********-----------------------Cons:1) LCD - The phone's biggest weakness is the screen. Don't get me wrong its an excellent LCD, only marred by lack of true blacks. Even then I am using the dark mode coz I like it.2) Photos app froze once for me when trying to share a large number of live photos on Whatsapp. Had to restart the phone to solve the issue. Hope this was an one off error.3) 5W charger - at this price it's fair to expect a fast charger, given the phone is capable of fast charging.4) Few apps that were free on Android are paid on iOS. I was surprised to find this. Nonetheless I bought the app as it was critical for me (didn't want to lose years of data from Android).5) Default zoom and text size make it difficult to read the text. Increasing either makes the screen seem less sharp.6) 3rd party keyboard - cannot be used in some apps. Only the pre-installed Apple keyboard shows up (maybe some security reason). This leads to poor trying experience. E.g. in the Outlook app SwiftKey never shows up. Can't get my head around this, as this breaks an otherwise smooth experience.--------------------************----------------------Final words - go for iPhone if you can afford it. Comparable Android flagships are way behind as an experience and complete package.***************************************Love the black color.***************************************Fun fact - tempered glass and case ordered an hour the phone were delivered the next morning and the phone was delivered late in the evening after continued follow up with customer care.",iPhone 11

"I purchased iPhone 11 on sale day and I received defective phone. After phone got full battery  drain. I kept on charging with timer clock, it took more than 3 hours exactly. My 2018 old  android will complete full charge in 45mins. I doubt now I received genuine product from amazon.Bonus Cash back not received..amazon promotions are fake.. instant discount and bonus cash back are Not giving for every order placed on amazon sale day on October 16th. I purchased iPhone 11 after enquiring several times before and after placing order. They confirmed me that instant discount and bonus cash back credited account once order is shipped. I received order 21st morning till now No Cashback.",iPhone 11
"Well i received a proper iPhone not a brick. 😛Received it in 2 days of order, everything as hopped and beyond expectations (expectation was receiving a brick in box 😂)They have improved their services and we can trust on amazon to deliver what they show.Thanks for discount and no cost options",iPhone 11
"it will be an understatement if i say iPhone 11 was the worst purchase of my life. i have been using android for as long as i can remember, and iOS doesnt give the flexibility of an Android. I used my brand new iphone for 2 whole days and i was done. i highly doubt if i will ever buy an iPhone ever again.Venting aside, below are the problems i encountered in the 2 days:> My 2 year old OnePlus gives the same battery backup as my 2 day old iphone> THERE IS NO FINGERPRINT SCANNER!! and the password is a 6 digit code, n it frequently keeps asking to enter this rather than unlock my phone with face id.> There is a limited set of alert tones available, each of which is so loud i was startled every single time i got a msg. PS. i use whatsapp for work extensively, there will be at least 60 diff groups im part of. you can imagine how horrible will it be to hear dolby digital kind of sounds before you even wake up> Whatsapp Web just doesnt sync real time. sometimes i get msg in my macbook first and few seconds later, the horrible startling tone is heard from the iPhone>I couldnt transfer anything from my android, the step to transfer data etc from android failed some 20 times before i gave up, i lost all my whatsapp back up, it was a mess.> I used the same SIM as in my OnePlus and i started facing frequent call drops, for the first time",iPhone 11
"Since day one ive raised a return req and none has replied,i made return req again and again,but of no use..Amazon are u really helping customers about problems they ve raised? Pity on u amazon.....i just wasted my money through ur platform .... Shame on u",iPhone 11
"Bought iPhone 11 recently. I must admit - this phone is super cool. Design is good. Purple color looks fresh & soothing to your eyes. I was confused between mint green & this color but when i compared both at one of the apple stores, i just couldn't resist ordering the purple. During the launch of the phone, the new two cameras design appeared weird but when you unbox the phone it looks Stunning. Night mode is also too good. Looks more natural & true to life. This phone is a must buy!",iPhone 11
"Okay, So All QHD+ screen Android users like me, you will definitely notice a difference in the HD LCD panel for first 3 days of your new iPhone 11 usage but post that you will get use to it and wont be able to differentiate substantially.A 13 BIONIC CHIP was something new, wont talk about fastness or snappy features, just know that it wont lag under any circumstances.Camera is actually good and above all android users will find the output photos to  be realistic than what we usually used to see in ANDROID that means NO LEEPA POTI by default.There is a different depth that you will notice in almost all photos.Videos are Super Stable ++.Ultra wide comes in handy for good instagram shots.IOS takes a couple of days to get use to, like using whatsapp / other apps which have different approaches in selecting images from gallery etc. but its user eccentric.Battery lasts a whole one day , on papers its approx. 3100 mah but will get the work done.5w charger good for people who wake up at 7 and put their phone on charging.Built quality solid.Games run butter smooth, but not a phone for heavy Gamers.Once you get an iphone, you will automatically be tempted to enter the ECOSYSTEM, so get ready to spend bucks on Airpods and iwatch because TASHAN tabhi aayega. (also they work best together)Overall I would say you will feel missing out on ceratin features from ANDROID but you will feel plus in some aspects.And When you enter an apple showroom with an iphone in your hand, salesman jyada poochta hai. so you feel great!!All in all Buy it because more productivity and optimum usage comes when you play less games and work more with your phone.",iPhone 11
"Bought it at 59k on prime day . Worth every single penny . If you are thinking about buying it just go ahead and buy it . I was an android user from the very beginning . My first android phone was moto g first gen then came oneplus 3t , asus zenfon 5z , and at last black shark 2 . Finally I decided to switch to ios since i own myself an ipad and MacBook pro . Trust me I regret nothing . The OS is so smooth like a hot knife through a butter . I am happy that i choose ios over android . I dont care much about customisations. All i need is good camera smooth os without any bloat wares . If you are looking for the same go for it",iPhone 11
"The only word to use for this Phone would be ""Perfect"". It's a perfect piece of art. I was fed up from using android phones and just wanted to move to the ios Platform. I was confused Between iPhone X and iPhone 11 and after a lot of Research and Youtube Searches, I Chose iPhone 11 and trust me it was one for the best decisions of my life. The UI is super smooth, the Build quality is amazing and the camera is just beauty. I am just falling in love with this phone. Although its a little bit costly but trust me its worth spending money on this piece of tech.Pros -- Camera is Amazing- Water-resistant- 4K Recording- Fluid Smooth touch- Never Lags in Heavy Gaming- And 100s of more ProsCons -- Haven't found any yet !!!So if you want to Switch to ios platform from android then just go for it and Chose iPhone 11 as your next device.",iPhone 11
Battery is defectiveAfter charging 100per the battery percentage drops into zero(0)From nowdays I will never trust Amazon .....It's not a single penny it's about 48kFor common person it's huge amountAnd no one will not accept such defective items.Meanwhile I tried to return but AmazonDirectly said talk to appleIs that fair ?@AMAZONI can say loudly that Flipkart is far better than Amazon I know theirs item price is high but atleast they care after being delivered,iPhone 11
"Coming from android and with no fast charging out of the box.... battery sucksCamera is awesome.... only pixels come close but this phone has an edge over every other flagship in the market.... portraits are the bestFace recognition works 2 times out of 10 in the post covid world and so yeah i miss the fingerprint scanner.Ios is 10/10 conpared to android. Gives you the premium feel.Display is something you wont complain about unless you do a side by side comparison with other phonesBuild quality is awesome but the phone slips out my hand a lot so use a bumper cover.No lagging issues..... phone heats up when doing heavy usage while charging but thats ok. All phones do that. Its a phone, not a super computer.Speakers- crazy good dual speakers but all flagships have that. Dont they?P.S. buy if you are a social media crazy kind of person and want insta ready photos straight out of your camera. If camera is not the reason for you buying the phone go for a one plus or a galaxy you will end paying less and getting much more.",iPhone 11

"After  5 years of loyalty towards OnePlus and 8years towards Android, Finally moved to an IPhone after all the intense brainstorming and research and the obvious Skepticism around different news floating around questioning its authenticity.For me, the seller was Darshita Electronics (All my 8phones to date has come from this seller and all of them were 100% genuine.About Iphone 11 128GB White, neatly packaged and delivered,To do's to check if the phone is Original,1. Shoot an uninterrupted video of the delivery you receive from the delivery guy and unboxing2. Ensure you capture the entire phone and accessories and point out any damage/defect (if observed)3. Check for the imei number from apple site and imei24 on status of any imei4. Boot the phone and wait for ""Apple logo to load"" setup the face lock - This is a key feature which nobody can copy5. Try locking the phone and unlocking the phone 4-5times using face unlock6. Screen bezels should be uniform from left, Right and bottom sides7. No additional softwares apart from Apple defaultsWhat did I like about this phone?1. Great body and design - Feels and fits perfect in hand (Damn balanced)2. Stellar Camera - Even a Novice would be able to capture great pictures and very easy yet powerful editing features3. Super fluid OS experience - Now I understood what ""Buttery experience meant all these years""4. Battery life is good, Screen-On-Time of ~7hours depending on the usage - I had my Wifi continuously switched on and Bluetoth for ~2hrs - I must say for 3100mah battery it very well optimized compared to 4000mah of other phones5. Wireless charging - (Which might be useful for some people but not me)6. A great deal from Security, Experience, Durability and Hardware Perspective7.  Still providing Charger and Earpods(Wired) - So better go for this compared to Apple online storeWhat is not present but doesn't make difference?1. 90Hz display could have made it amazing but can't expect that from a year-old model and doesnt make difference in india at least2. 5G is not present - So, good to go for 2-3years without updating any further than IOS153. InBox charger could have been 12W(2hr charging time) charger instead of 5W(3.5hr charging time) - OnePlus provide 40min charging4. Super Amoled could have improved the viewing experience but its still fineRecommendation: If can spend up to 55k then just go for it without any hesitation. Better than any 40-50k phone out there. Colors available are also great. I was looking for Mint but didn't get it. Try your luck though. Hope this helped.",iPhone 11
"The apple Iphone is always best in class when purchased at discounted price its always worth the money, however I didn’t like amazon sending no bill they have an option to download invoice and guaranty receipt separately ( why not together as one bill) the guaranty receipt has one IMEI incorrect and won’t be valid at apple service center. Tried to get in touch with amazon for bill correction but they have no online option to do that online as well as when I called amazon customer care can’t connect with a person and their automated options doesn’t cover my concern.Worst of amazon and I will recommend not to buy apple phones with them cause when you will get no warranty from apple and resale value of the phone due to incorrect/separate bill and warranty receipt.",iPhone 11
Avoid iphone 11. Save your money. I feel its better to wait for the next iphone or get yourself another phone altogether. Apple’s standards are dropping year by year. But the price is instead rising over the roof with bad products,iPhone 11
"Today finally I got my iPhone 11, but it doesn't go well as expected, the ringtone volume goes off as it rings, not audible and even while on phone(on conversation) it needs Loudspeaker on to make the sound audible. I am going to return this iPhone to the Amazon and i suggest you friend don't buy this phone as most of iphones have some or less problems.",iPhone 11
"Excellent phone so far. Bought it for more secure access. Fortunately amazon delivery this time was good (my past delivery experience have been bad).On downside, this phone is heavy as brick. Compared to similarly sized s10... this is too heavy.  Single hand use easily tired fingers and hand. Pictures are great but the wide angle is not good on people as it distorts edges in pictures. Speaker sound is also slightly mutted. Face id fails occasionally.I can live with most of the issues but the weight of phone is dissapointing",iPhone 11
It's amazing mobile. It captures pictures like real. Good battery life.,iPhone 11

   Really disappointed. This purchase has saddened me so much. This was my first iPhone purchase ever, I was so happy but when I unboxed the product, I saw a gap between the frame and back glass, this may be a refurbished product. I will not purchase costly products again from Amazon.",iPhone 11
Received a defective display product. And now after lots of follow-ups amazon asks me to return the product. Where as I am looking for replacement. But they're not willing to help. They say the product is not in stock.,iPhone 11
"The retailer  is duping people. I got a dead product which is having motherboard issue. It doesn't switch on, just a dummy. The IMEI in the bill doesn't match with the device. Even the apple care representatives are avoiding us to buy from amazon specially during festive season.Basically the retailers are mixing the dead products  and other products so there is 50-50 chance you might get a dead product.",iPhone 11
"Happily upgraded my parents to an iPhone from Android.Pros:1. This is the best device in all respects. The best of the best flagship Android phones cannot match up to this one at a 46k price point. Pixel4A was a let down IMO.2. Wireless charging, NFC, nice camera, regular iOS updates, a no frills phone, IP68 rating, etc; what more can you want from your phone?Cons:1. There'd be a few surprises for a religious Android user, e.g. one cannot likely transfer files without installing iTunes. It is a breeze for general usage viz shopping, booking cabs, making payments, etc.2. It has an e-SIM for dual SIM support and as of now you can only use AirTel or Jio e-Sim in India. The perils of getting one is a bit complicated but we'll documented.3. The Apple ecosystem is a trap, once you are in it'd be super hard to get out for really good reasons. You might end up buying lots of iProducts and burning a lot of money, so proceed with caution.4. Read the terms and conditions ofApple warranty. Most likely water damage isn't covered by Apple. This isn't your phone, it's your kidney, handle with care go buy some insurance.",iPhone 11
"It's a bad buying experience from Amazon as they are not giving Amazon pay cashback as stated by their offer. Nowadays Amazon shopping experience is taking a nosedive as they started putting fine details of terms and conditions of the offer in so many places that you cant take screenshots of every place to get complete offer details handy with you and their usual cashback will come to one account after sales end. So no way when you complain to the customer care executive you can show them the complete offer details and they are clueless about the offer anyways.Soon seems Amazon shopping experience will also reach the level of unbearable like Flipkart. Time to go offline shopping now.BTW the phone is good. The camera is astonishing, the colour reproduction in the images iphone I doubt anyone can match that. But as per my experience It's better to buy it offline after checking it personally, spending few thousand bucks makes more sense rather than risking much larger amount. I am lucky phone comes out as original but I have heard about many fraud cases from both Amazon and Flipkart. So choose wisely",iPhone 11
"Never buy apple products on Amazon, I had worse experience of buying iphone 11. I got a refurbished phone for a premium price more over there is no customer support at all on the app.",iPhone 11

Guys I have learned that there are two types of screen display color in iPhone 11. One is with yellow tint and other one is blue tint.  And my phone which I got from amazon is yellow tint which is very low in brightness. Blue tint is good and brighter. Do not purchase yellow tint phones. Not happy with amazon service as they are not exchanging to blue tint.,iPhone 11

I ask to amazon for replacement or return ..but they saying that they dont have authority to replace/refund you have to go for service centre.if they dont have authority to replace/refund why they selling apple product.its just only 1 day after purchased and i had raised the issue even they have the 7 day replacement policy.So dont go on amazon for expensive product..think 100 times while buying..",iPhone 11
"Nothing to dislike about the product and seller.Security: I only hope that apple will come up with an iOS update to add option for those wanting to disable swipe after the phone is unlocked with Face ID.Camera quality: Could see visible grains in photos taken even during daylight as compared to the photos taken from iPhone 5s even though it’s without crisp details. iPhone 11 boasts of camera features, else the picture quality isn’t impressive. Video quality is good though.Battery: It’s not a gaming phone even though it runs popular titles smoothly. So, it will go about an entire day in moderate usage without much to play.Voice assistant: Siri is few seconds slower to respond to ‘Hey Siri.’Sound: Sounds good while watching videos. Watch videos with good quality audio in landscape mode/widescreen for better experience since it has speakers on top and on the bottom. Use EarPods/AirPods for the better.Overall, it’s a good buy in 2020 with not much to bargain for what you pay.",iPhone 11

I don’t think the quality of phone is good. Might not buy an iPhone anywhere else than apple store.The phone hangs few times everyday. Touch is not as smooth and its heating up as well. Didn’t hear all this from a friend who is using iPhone11 too. Must be a refurbished or low quality phone beng sold here.,iPhone 11
I brought this product from Amazon 2days back and observed a scratch in the screen and a dent on top of the back panelApple care has provided the case ID to check with Amazon.

"I purchased the iPhone 11 for my daughter. She was very keen to have her own iPhone. On 20 oct 2020, after receiving the package I opened it and switched on the iPhone. It was devastating for us, my daughter in particular to see a red spot in the screen. Immediately I took up with Amazon help. But they disowned on the pretext that Apple, the manufacturer can only help on this. I contacted Apple help but they tried to shift the responsibility to seller. We were put in a state of helplessness. Finally I decided to visit the Apple service centre. On 21 Oct 2020 I visited the service centre, they acknowledged the problem in the iPhone Screen and took it with a promise either to fix the screen or change the mobile. I contended, I have bought a brand new iPhone to gift to my daughter and I don’t want a “repaired tag” in this. I want the iPhone to be replaced. They said decision of Apple would be binding on me, I can’t demand anything. I am still waiting to hear from them. I don’t know what Apple is going to do.In the meantime Amazon and the seller are happy to have sold a faulty product to me and the poor me after running from pillar to post is waiting for the mercy of Apple.",iPhone 11

Had preordered it arrived at the same day when it was officially out on retail store. Prompt delivery and with excellent packaging. Been using a few days and for me it’s an excellent upgrade from 7 to 11. Full review I will be dropping later after few days of regular usage. N I love the pastel green color 😊,iPhone 11
Switching from Android to iOS and everything is amazing people are saying that phone has heating issues but I didn’t find anything related heating. After 5 days of uses Im now big fan of Apple products. Don’t think about anything just buy that product you will never regret thanks,iPhone 11
After handling the phone now I can get convinced for the price as the make and user interface is really amazing but there are some corns for me because I am a long-time Android user so I believe it takes time for me to get into fully. The main concern is the headphone jack as we have only two options one we have to use lightning cable or Bluetooth headphones. Other than that it is really a great phone for professional users with a royal look.,iPhone 11
"Due to existing COVID situation, my phone got delivered 2 days late. Amazon team ensured and took care of quality delivery. There are lots of negative review for buying iPhone 11 from Appario retail. Even I had my doubts but after having words with Amazon customer care & their assurance, I went for it. As soon as I received the product, I registered it online for validation. Even you should do it first. I had no issues with my phone. I rigorously used it for few days & only then sharing the feedback. Face recognition, camera quality, processor performance & battery life are way better. You will like it.Design is good, though the phone seems bit heavy.When I unboxed my iPhone, I found: regular Lightning cable, a pair of EarPods ending on a Lightning plug, and 5W charger. Though iPhone 11 supports 18W fast charging through USB Power delivery, it is not bundled with the new 18W Apple charger that comes with the Pro models. You will have to buy it (12 watt or 18 watt charger) separately, if you want to charge your phone quickly.

"An excellent response received from AMAZON, IF I am not sharing my experience, it will deemed to b an unfair on my part.During recent festive season, being a prime member, i hv purchased iphone 11on 16th 12.05 am.

He said, we have made a tie up with company to sell these products from AMAZON platform, hence apple is only the authority to help u in this regards.  I explained i m a amazone customer since more then 5 years, during this 5 years period  i hv  purchased high value consumer durables with pre payment orders including in last festival season purchased smartphone one+ 7 pro, Uptill now I am fully satisfied with the cost, product and service of AMAZONE.(henceforth a trust image and credit of AMAZONE is very well established in my mind and belief)Otherwise I could purchased  iphone 11 from apple store,  it is now available,online apple store india, with more discount scheme.After prolonged discussion and my special request,he took the decision in my favor to replace it with providing me New iphone 11 without recovering any extra charges ( though i hv offered penalty to me if any)Uptill now amazone was good for me for online safe shopping but now taking proud of (prime member ) being a  cutomer of AMAZONE.If i had purchased iphone 11 from local market and if happened like this, would not  be possible for replacement.Salute to AMAZONE.

"First and foremost, I would like to talk about the seller, as I have seen many reviews on Amazon stating that don't buy an iphone on amazon or from this seller. The product delivery was really fast and I got the phone within 2 days of ordering it. Got the 128gb variant for 65000 rupees during the prime days sale. The phone was in perfect condition and brand new. I was a bit concerned after reading so many reviews on amazon that this seller can't be trusted but I will advise you to go for it.Now about the iphone, The white colour looks amazing. This is my first iphone and I'm writing this review after using it for around 10 days.The camera quality of this phone is superb and low light photos are just amazing, don't even try to compare it to the one plus or the high end samsung phones, they are no where near the camera quality of this iphone.2nd Photo is a low light photo taken by this iphone.The Battery backup is decent.The Sound Quality is nice.Face recognition is really fast.Screen is amazing and you definitely don't miss the oled screen, if you are not a big tech geek, you won't even notice the difference in your day to day life.Overall, I am totally satisfied with my iphone and you can go for it without any second thoughts.Hope this helps ! ✌🏼",iPhone 11

Pro- Camera & PerformanceCon- Hideous Notch (why d hell nobody talks about it??)Batteryटिप्पणी-भारत में अब Apple अपने किसी अतिविशिष्ट hardware या software के नहीं अपितु दिखावे की वस्तुमात्र (वैभव-प्रतीक) होने के कारण विक्रित होती है।जिसमें दूसरों को हीन तथा स्वयं को मिथ्याश्रेष्ठ या धनवान दिखाने की फूहड़ व भौंडी मानसिकता का कंपनी अपने लाभहेतु दोहन करने का प्रयास करती है।इसके अतिरिक्त मुझे इस फ़ोन में ऐसा कुछ भी अतिविशेष दिखाई नहीं दिया जो इससे आधे या उससे भी कमदाम के फ़ोन में उपलब्ध न हो।,iPhone 11

Had bought this phone 1 day ago and it already started heating up a lot and started getting discharged really oftenPls do not buy such expensive products from amazon,iPhone 11
So far it is good. But with lot of reviews related to heating up of phone I am bit worried. Few updates for iOS is required to be at par with android.Update: After using it for almost 3 months I could say that android OS is far better than iOS. Apple need to work on lot of things. I would say Apple should give android phones to their developers to know what can be added to iOS. Overall useless operating system.Hope with new release they will match with android.Those using android and thinking of switching over to iPhones please don’t even think of it.,iPhone 11
I was very much worried when I ordered this phone from Amazon sale cuz of so many negative reviews  n grabbed it in 44k around. When I unboxed it and check warranty along with every possible detail I found it to be a superb phone at a jaw dropping price. My phone has no heating issue or camera issue or whatever issue these guys have mentioned in reviews. All over a great deal. Just go for it blindly as it’s still cheaper than what u get in offline store.,iPhone 11
"I had lots of expectation from this product but even just after unboxing and starting for configuration it started heating. It took 4.5 hour to recharge 60% bettery its very slow. I complained in the Amazone for return or replaced , they denied and ask to go to Apple service station for resolution. After checking at service station they says its normal and bettery will take 4.5 hours to charge its also normal. The bettery also drains very fast in4-5 hours. I have never expected such a bad profuct from apple like brand. And amazon is aslo not taking it for replacement. i simply wasted my money on brand.please never never purchase this product as even cheapest android will take not more then 1 hour in charging and will run for whole the day when new.I found few more customers like at service station complaining the same but they dont have answer and convincing them by saying same ' its normal'.. what a rabbish product with what a poor marketing from amazon...i highly discourged all of u not to buy this product ...Amazon is just doung marketing of this product they dont replace or refund ...",iPhone 11
Me a ten year android user finally switched to iOS and this was a deal which couldn’t be refused. About iPhone everything is great. Just two cons comparatively less battery back up if you coming from 5000/6000mAH android phones and screen has a bit of yellow tint but it can be resolved from settings. So overall 8.5/10 for the phone.,iPhone 11
Received a defective piece. There’s no option to replace. Apple store is 250kms away from my address.,iPhone 11
"I have been an iPhone user 8 years now. The battery backup is very much improved in iPhone 11. Performance is great.Highlighting an issue which happened for me but was resolved. May help others as well.After I started the new phone, in the initial steps I chose to set it up using my old device 6s.Post that the phone was super heated from a short usage, battery was getting drained and voice memos failed to respond after launch.Apple customer care helped a lot and eventually tried the option to reset the iPhone 11 and set it up from scratch as raw. Restored the data from iCloud later.Strange, but the phone now works like a charm as I mentioned in the start.Evaluate your usage and budget to make the right choice.",iPhone 11
Of course u r purchase a I phone but when u purchase phone on this cost they should give airpods....m expecting the pods but again having wired earphones .it means I spent again money for buying airpods...that is not fair with customers..but another side when u have the it's nice....nice phone,iPhone 11
"Finally got ""iphone"".Great from Amazon great india sales.Battery life apple phone is given 3100mAH but it works equally with the android 6,000mAH easily lasts one day.And all are well known about quality of iPhones even its 12mp.Phone feels little bit wider than normal phones.",iPhone 11
"I have booked Iphone 11 during the sale on 16th October and there is cash back offer in amazon of Rs.1250 and its clearly written that cashback will receive as amazon pay within 3 working days after shipping.I have not got it still the cashback. Even after calling to customer care, there is no response and i've not got the cash back amount.This is really worst thing from amazon on cheating customer by showing discounts/offers/deals.",iPhone 11
"Phone is perfect in all aspect just few things lacksBattery charging is slow even if I’m charging with Huawei 18 watt chargerAnd 2nd camera I would this could be bcz I’m coming from pixel 3xl and if i have to compare in 10 I would give 10 to pixel even though it didn’t have ultra wide lens and this I would give 6 .Only in 2 thing is got disappointed1 battery charging and backup2 cameraAnd make no mistake it QQUALCOMM quick charge so don’t go for suck Warp .vooc ,Dash , 65 waat and and such kind of charge bcz it only supports PD charge (power delivery) a charger which has out put USB C for example pixel charger and Samsung note 9 and above.",iPhone 11
Ordered on 16th (Midnight) for ₹51.7k using the Offer on Great Indian Festival Sale. It arrived the Same Day the Following afternoon.Excellent Deal and Delivery by Amazon.,iPhone 11
The new iPhone mobile I purchased through Amazon getting heated while using the device for few minutes. Also noted the charges are getting extra hot.So please contact the use urgently and replace the devise urgently (refer the delivery address and contact number from my order),iPhone 11
I bought it from Appario. This is the first time i am unsatified with AMAZON. Particulary after spending lots of bucks i could expect bettery quality phone. But this guys delivered me defective product. I have taken 100 plus photos and i could clearly see the difference. The photos are not even competing with iphone 6s and samsung a50. I am sure this is not apple branded product. some dupliacte product. Amazon please dont encourage these type of sellers.,iPhone 11
"Here’s my long term review on IPhone 11 64GB. I had ordered this phone around 7months back and this has been my daily driver since then. To give you a perspective I am using the dual sim in here reliance Jio as esim and Vodafone idea as physical sim. Both works fine and network connectivity is great.WiFi reception is Average I would say.Call quality is awesome one can hear clean and crispThe speaker is Loud and the music plays great I love itThe display is good but not great like my Old Note 9, but still colour reproduction is accurateBattery back up is good and it typically lasts a whole day.The phone is slippery so I use a back case.Nothing more to say about i0S and it’s updates they are great",iPhone 11
"if you are an android user, you will have many letdowns. first and formost home button, back button, close all options. camera does not seem out of the world compared to other android phones 20K range. you will have to loose whatsapp chat completely, lot many features for users which are simple in android are either not there or you have to learn to use it in a different way.in summary if you are a decade old android user, you will not be comfortable",iPhone 11
Don't buy at all. Display is the worst display from Apple ever. Camera performance is cheap.,iPhone 11
"Dear Amazon Support/Customer Care,This ls to write and bring to your notice regarding the extremely bad quality of product and support provided by Amazon.To brief you about the situation, I bought an apple iphone-11 from Amazon and not from any other platform because of the trust on Amazon and it's great support team. But this time around, it was a completely opposite situation. After receiving the product on 30.10.2020, the product was discolored ( like damage); I immediately tried to replace the product through the options available on the app, but the app would just direct me back to the link of apple support website and contact number. After several tries, I final got through the apple support, only to be redirected to the apple store. On reaching the apple Stores during the limited stringent work hours, I was asked to come the next day. On the next day, I was informed that this issue needs to be taken up by Amazon only.After being extremely tired of this entire long process, with great difficulty, I could connect with the Amazon customer support. The customer support assured me of resolving the issue and asked me to wait for 24 hours to get a call.Post this, it has already been more than 40 hours and I m yet to receive any call. Furthermore, when I am trying to call the same number, I fail to connect despite repeated tries. I am extremely disappointed with the quality of your product and support; which is least expected from Amazon.Today being my last day of eligible replacement, I write to you with the Last hope of some relief.I expect atleast this time around Amazon will help its long loyal customer, who is losing faith in the quality of Amazon.",iPhone 11
I recieved not working accesories and amazon  tell me to bring deny letter from amazon wow this is the seller concern such a bad service from amazon not worth to buy such expensive product from amazon i suggest not buy expensive products from amazon and from this typ of sellers too,iPhone 11
"Great phone with a very good camera and FaceId feature. The phone does not have a finger print reader. It was very easy to transfer information from my old phone. Just switch on the new phone, connect it to wifi, plug both the old and new phone to power and place them snear each other. Then start the transfer process. in approx. 30 minutes its all done. All the apps, photos, songs etc. get transferred directly for the old device to the new device. No need for backup and restore. Then transfer the SIM from your old phone to the new phone and you are all set. Seamless!!!",iPhone 11
After reading the reviews I completely scared about the authenticity of the phone. I would like to thanks to all people who made me aware in such a way that Firstly I verified my phone before even putting the SIM card.I got the brand new iPhone with no technical or physical glitches. Thanks to Amazon and apparition retail.Phone is working flawlessly. Registered on Apple site and got warranty of one year.Rest of the features are already described.,iPhone 11
Recently i purchased oneplus 8 and just after iPhone 11 however felt more comfortable with features and UI of oneplus 8. It feels like degradation for me from bigger and more clear display to small LCD with no refresh rate. Major pain area is battery charging from 15mins of oneplus to hours for iPhone. Feature rich shortcut in oneplus to static options like no shortcut for turning on or off location.,iPhone 11
Unfortunately charger and ear plugs found missing in the package.Customer care fails to compensate in this regard.Worst purchase I have ever seen,iPhone 11
"I am a techno person and hard core apple and android user. Go through my review carefully before buying.I had iPhone 5s as my first phone.  It performed really well and ended up with dead battery. I had to switch to samsung M30 and no doubt that phone was some kind of rock made for a careless all day user. I used it for about a year and still its battery worked like charm for about 3 days of moderate use. (I dont play mobile games) This thing really amazed me. Still, a good battery is not everything. I was alway un satisfied with android UI and performance. And decided to switch back to ios.I grabbed this phone at a great deal. Delivery was quite fast. Once I had hands-on, I found that apple still have not worked on battery thing. Not really sure why. It seems to be draining a bit faster.  Will update the review after few months.Build quality is remarkable.IOS 14 is a magic.Phone seems a bit bulky and heavy compared to an android device of same size.Do not expect the premium feel as in iPhone X.I was confused between purple and white and chose the white which I think was the good decision.  Purple looks a bit faded because its light purple.Front and rear cams are remarkable for the price. Undoubtedly. Attached some samples.If you are a photo person, this one is for you.Final verdict : Blindly go for it if you are moderate user and not much into social media or chatting all the day. If you are someone in your twenties who stays online all the day or into a new relationship,  be ready for repeated charge cycles.  😅This is a premium device for someone with balanced online and real life.Do check out the attached photos. Hope this helps.Check the battery health once you get the product. Mine was 100 percent as expected.Thanks to amazon for the genuine product and intact packaging.Update after approx one and half month of usage : Battery performance is exceeding the expectations. 😍😍",iPhone 11
Phone is stylish and i am first time apple user .its look good and it would be too early to comment as i got the phone today only. I am disappointed as it was shown the airpods with the phone but instead of that they send the wired earphones. If someone is buying the phone in 60k plus he or she should be given the things which is mentioned at least.  I am waiting if the airpods are being sent by the seller else will return the phone due to wrong description . How ever other things are fine and looks are great. Will give a brief review later. Thank you,iPhone 11
"after watching so many bad reviews i was worried about the mobile it is fake or real?so many videos out on youtube also...but to be frank i received a very good and quality product its original not fake..i checked my i phone on apple site also by puttiing my serial number of mobile its verified by apple...received with charger ,cable and wired headphones...Very happy to buy this ..Thanx Amazon.",iPhone 11
Bought this mobile in great Indian festival for 46k with all.possiblr discounts... I have seen few reviews and also youtubers videos that its a defective product or clone mobile... But I received genuine product with full warranty... E comm giant like amzon will not do fraud maybe some of there employees or delivery boys can do this type of things... Will this is my honest review ...I am not paid to review this nor I received anycashback offer for this review its just that I have seen so many reviews and videos so thought of sharing this...,iPhone 11
"Very sad, after five days , microphone for Siri , face time , IMO and WhatsApp stopped working. Was taken to I care , diagnosed that phone is having serious hardware issue, phone is send to Bangalore for further diagnosis .Very bad supplier for such an expensive phone, I couldn’t use for more than five days.Please beware of this supplier.",iPhone 11
Mobile device is good. Good upgrade from iPhone 6s to iPhone 11. Overall performance is satisfactory. Battery life is expected to be better because apple has mentioned it lasts longer compared to other devices. But I feel battery exhausts a bit quickly as this is not expected.  I faced lot of problems to receive the order in spite of being prime customer. Reached out to Amazon customer care for delivery issues and spoke to 4 executives. Among them 2 executives responded very badly. My order was delayed by 3 days due to delivery guy unable to scan secured package. This is my first bitter experience with Amazon in years of using Amazon. Please Amazon try to reduce and eliminate these kind of problems and make sure executives doesn’t hold the call for more than 15 minutes continuously after picking the call. Also make sure executives have a good knowledge on how to handle these issues. Thanks.,iPhone 11
This is my first Apple phone. I  moved to this in a hope of better phone than Android. This is the worst phone I have used till now.Network: It keeps on variating . Android is far better than this.Music playback:I connected to this my car and played music . Music comes as such I am playing on old tap recorder.music keep dragging.Battery: Battery just drine out in half with minimal usage.Usability:  You hardly able to transfer data. These days WhatsApp is all. You can no way get your old phone WhatsApp data to new phone.You will hardly get less than 50% applications.,iPhone 11
I shifted from Android to iOS thinking it would be a wonderful experience.....guess everyone gets a chance to be wrong.....Amazon sold me a defective product .........the phone shuts down and restarts randomly as per its whims and fancies....the Apple customer support was of not great help either .....they say the phone is fine... ...u need to get it checked at the service center.....so after spending almost 50k....  have no option but to run about to the service center to try and fix the issue.....Thanks Apple and Amazon for the Special Phone!!!!!!!!!,iPhone 11

Initialy m a oneplus user. Addicted to best cameras. Researchd alot to buy this iphone 11. Amazon prime gave me this iphone 128gb for 63k for whch i'm soo grateful to it. In love with this camera.",iPhone 11
"So, I bought it in Amazon sale just for 47,999/- so here is my one week usage review for you guys to decide you want this or not. So let’s talk about camera I would say bang on camera so good quality pictures in low light or in dark. In terms of performance phone nailed in that but only one problem I think I must include here is if you play PUBG or any heavy game like that phone heats not that much but it heats everyone is here complaining about heating problems trust me phone not heat while normal usage only when you play heavy graphics game like PUBG cod fort nite. So that’s all .",iPhone 11
"I am writing this review after one week of my purchase from Amazon,Actually I was waiting for iPhone 12.but due to lots of delay information.i changed my mind to buy iPhone 11.And I am very happy with this phone.the Phone is amazing.but it takes almost three hour to full charge that makes me so disappointed.and lots of reviewer are saying about heating issue and they are also saying don’t buy from Amazon. But I didn’t got any issue like this.So I will say go for it without any second thought.100 percent Orginal product.Thanks Amazon thanks seller and thanks to delevery boy.thank you everyone.",iPhone 11
"Software is not working properlyReceived faulty item, Amazon is selling Refurbished mobiles or second copy of the phone in the name of discountI will strongly request  people don't go for online shopping from Amazon.. they are attracting you in the name of discount but selling old and used phones",iPhone 11
ordered this product on amazon big billion day sale. the product packaging was very good and the product is 100 percent genuine as one can see on apple id when the product got registered and got full 1 year warranty. the phone is very fst and the software experience is very fluid. got this phoneat rs 44k. the best deal i can get on iphone. one looking to purchase iphone can surely put money on this. tough at this price factor one can get android with much more features. but if u want a unique experience then apple is the way to go,iPhone 11
"It’s just an ok phone with an Apple logo...Otherwise features are average, charging this phone takes ages, this is my first IPhone and I am regretting it...one may buy oneplus etc for better features and experience",iPhone 11
"I bought this iPhone a week ago and although this might be a review done too soon but I know that this phone never disappoints. There are a lot of good phones at a lesser price like oneplus 8 and samsung s20 but if you want a a lag free experience and a simple OS performance - go for the iPhone.I also read a lot of negative reviews about the seller but it was a secured and happy experience for me! Appario did a good job here!Pros:1. A13 bionic chip - Smooth OS with no lags and top of the line processor2. If you're purchasing this for gaming - I did for PUBG then you won't be disappointed! The FPS and gaming experience is surreal3. Speakers are of excellent quality and are quite loud4. Camera does a more than decent job with the night mode being a stand out!Cons:1. Battery is one thing iPhone really needs to take care of! 3200 MAH won't let you go a long time without charging2. The LCD panel is not that great when compared to oneplus 8, lacks in screen refresh rate too with a 60Hz screen refresh rate3. The charger is a slow charger and takes around 2.5 hours to fully charge the device.",iPhone 11

No comments on apple productPros:1. Rich finishing2. Awesome battery life .You will get two days for normal usage. For hard users it will be one day strongly3. Marvellous photography using iPhone 11. Portrait mode is more attractive compare to previous versions. Wide angle camera Adds more attraction to the phone as well as more convenient while taking pictures.Night mode is awesome.4.front camera is very nice5.performance wise A13 chip never lags You in any instance.6.Finally the brand value Apple Apple apple. I got this phone at the better price in 47999.,iPhone 11
"Great iphone if you are looking for long term usage and durability, excellent cameras and performanceThe only con at this price is the charger provided is only 5 Watt takes a long time to charge even though the battery is small comparatively.If you are on budget and want to buy apple its the best value for money optionDisplay is still very good many people wont miss the oled from the pros.",iPhone 11
"Brilliant phone with fantastic features at an unbeatable price. To all those naysayers comparing Android with iOS, I have just one thing to say - Use iOS once and then we’ll see who comes out trumps. Face ID Unlock is best in class, amazing camera clarity, super fast processor, iOS 14.1, Battery that lasts more than a day with a single charge. Do you wish for anything more? Nah. All things packed in one phone. The one, the only, the Master of all. My Phone - iPhone🙂",iPhone 11
"After lot of comparison among iphone 11, samsung s20 and one plus 8 pro (As all three in some or other offer are available for price just under 60000Rs), I went ahead with iphone 11.It’s my first flagship phone and I am totally loving it. It’s camera capabilities are well known and I need not comment, can be used to make movies too!!. My average screen time is 7 hours, and a full charge a day is sufficient for me. 3 hours is required for a full charge and one can purchase 12W or 18W charger to decrease the time to charge. Face recognition works well even in dark conditions and is fast but it don’t work with a mask.",iPhone 11
"Seller sent a defective peace on 1 day camera wasn’t working, tried and tired contacting Apple for appointments and running behind , Amazon doesn’t assist at all after period is over however this issue was raised on day 1",iPhone 11
"Well the first question is, is it worth buying iPhone 11, when 12 is just launched, well yes very much if you are using any earlier version, then at this price point (48k-3k hdfc card discount=45k) it was definitely!! Factor in your old iphone price, it comes around 40k, this was a deal worth taking!!Also, iphone 12 requires magsafe charger so add more to its price, plus 5G shall take atleast two more years to come, so not a good bargain for spending almost double.Back to iPhone 11, it is no doubt a superb phone..11 feels so much more suave and classy, so much better user interface with ios14, so improved battery backup, earlier iPhone models users will definitely feel the difference, superb selfie camera with studio light in portrait mode and much more..Only cons I felt is 5w charger supplied with it, which takes 3 hrs to charge the phone, if 18w charger can do the same in 1.5 hrs, why the same is not supplied? If Apple wants to give “amazing user experience” then it feels like a deal breaker, may be because of the fact that slow charging helps in prolonging the battery life, but then why option of 18w charger and shorten battery life, perhaps Apple also face the dilemma and done away with charger only now onwards..Overall iPhone 11 makes more sense then 12 at this price point and in the absence of 5G currently in India. Happy with the purchase and super fast delivery in less then 48 hours.🤘.",iPhone 11
"I am brought new iphone 11 ,but there is microphone it's not working and I am facing big problem, there is no any pick up service from the end of amzon and iphone and I am very disappointed of the service of both company.",iPhone 11
"Superb. It’s a no brainer even in Aug-20 when the iPhone 12 is so close to launch. I was skeptical about the screen but it hardly makes a visible difference between lcd and amoled screen in a 6 inch size. Besides the benefits of an lcd screen include cheap repairs, better battery life. I was using a galaxy s10 before which has the best display in any smartphone but happy with a mediocre display (with True Tone - which actually gives less strain to your eyes), Face ID unlock and an awesome battery life and the best camera in the market, I don’t think I will be needing anything else. For people who move from Android, yes the trade off is that you can’t multitask on 2 apps (split view) but for proper multitasking you anyway need a PC right ?",iPhone 11
"Phone is good . Honestly I expected much more from my first iPhone . Deeply regretted after using this . Quality of camera , phone weight and facial recognition is not of a quality standard . I don’t have the option to return it . But if apple can make the changes or upgrade it . It will be good . Camera has too much noise in the picture quality . Blurred image is common in all the pictures . Facial recognition is worst . Even my sister is able to open . It’s a big flaw in the AI part of this . Need to change on this part .Overall not satisfied",iPhone 11
I have always been an iPhone fanatic and it’s really worth it. I really would like to thank the seller and amazon delivering the product during covid 19 and that too before the mentioned delivery time.The performance of the phone is amazing compared to any phone in the market. I love the facial rec and the camera quality a lot with different modes.NOTE: I would suggest the seller to correct the bullet points or spec where it is mentioned that the phone come with AIRPODS.,iPhone 11
"Phone is good but Amazon will flip what they have promised. I have not received My cash back, when I raised a complaint they told it will be credited to your account in 3  days, after 3 days also not received my cash back so again  I have raised a complaint, they told same thing after 3days I’ll receive the cashback still not received. After 6 days now they are telling cash back options is not there for this phone, completely flip. Don’t no what is happening with them , I lost complete hope on them, I don’t have Any trust on them.",iPhone 11

Value for money at a competitive price coupled  with zero cost EMIs making it affordable  and lighter for the pocket. I am sure this will give run for money . plus the Amzons timely and Cuatious supply . The delievery representative insisted on openeing the packet before confirming on system so as to ensure right packet was delivered. Packing was having also safety precaustions for handling. Thanks to Amazon too for handling  a Premium product like iphone in the above manner . It enhanced my confidence of purchasing high value/ticket items at Amazon onlie and look forward to buying a bike or car on Amazon one day with the services of brick and mortar shop.. All the best Amazon and thanks to Iphone once again for unbeatable product. one big difference for a avid user of Samsung is that battery does not drain while kept overnight it remains 100 % if not used unlike Samsung which drains even if unused and even shut off,iPhone 11
"Received original product one day before the mentioned date.I saw videos where most of the people said they received fake product from amazon, i was scared but it looks the people who make such videos are fake.This is my 4 mobile from amazon and all received products are original.In terms of iphone review no doubt about their quality and reliability.I am happy and satisfied customer of Amazon.Thankyou!!",iPhone 11

"I bought my iphone 11 64gb red variant from the seller Darshita Electronics. The product came in a bubble wrap, securely sealed.

"Frankly, i was slightly sceptical in ordering 50k phone from Amazon given the 10k difference vis-a-vis apple store pricing, mainly due to some critical reviews/complaints seen on the review page and partially due to people recieving surf excel packets instead of lenovo laptop - however these variables did not affected the product in any way :Positives:Price Point : Brought this at ₹46k during the 2020 Amazon Great Indian Festival.Fast : Apple A13 Bionic Chip is beaten only by A14 Bionic chipSecure : You close your eyes and face id won't unlock your phone.Camera : with wide angle lens - 4k video recording+editingGaming : I played asphalt 9 and experienced no heating issue even after playing it for 30 straight minutes.Ecosystem Benefits: only those having an apple ecosystem will understand this hence not writing here.What i Dislike:Depreciating Asset : Apple phones have very bad reputation when is comes to asset depreciation of ""Budget iPhone"" leading to customer dissatisfaction. i.e. the ones who brought this phone at printed MRP ₹68300.00 will feel cheated: they have lost ₹23k just by using this phone for 6-8 months earlier than me:",iPhone 11
"Very much satisfied about the purchase. Was a little concerned about whether I would be getting genuine product or not, but kudos to the seller (Darshita electronics), they kept my trust. Got a September manufactured made in India unit as well. Every accessory working fine and no heating issues as well. Only heats up a little with my 20 Watts fast charger. I would recommend not to use the fast charger on daily basis. It’s okay to use it sometimes when you are in a hurry. Otherwise use the regular 5 Watts slow charger. Apple has provided that because of a reason. Only concern is with apple not amazon, which is the cable quality. Very very poor quality which starts to chip off within a few months. So due to sale, i ordered the Belkin cable for charging as it is best in class and MFI certified. Would recommend to use only good quality MFI cables if you want long life for your phone. Other than that, camera quality is top notch and always seems to improve with every software update. Battery life is epic, lasts a full day although I don’t do gaming on iphone, still I am quite a heavy user.Very very happy with the purchase. Thank you Amazon and Darshita electronics. ☺️",iPhone 11
"To be honest, I feel like I paid the price for the BRAND only. Iphone is definitely 2 generation behind android. You can find similar specs (except camera) in mid range flag ships like oneplus series.I won't recommend you to purchase this if you looking for value for money because this is just brand for money.This is my first Iphone I was using oneplus series before buying this. I will summarize the comparison in an easy way.Camera = Definitely good but not the best (selfie mirror effect is annoying you can not change it in setting you have to edit the picture and then flip it, which not a good experience for me)Battery life = Good, can last a day long but also takes so long to get fully charged (I would advise you not to completely drain you battery keep it charging whenever you can)Overall experience = happy but not satisfied, Android has lots of small features which makes you life easy but Iphone is not offering those small features also android offers you to customize your phone they way you want but Iphone doesn't. Also it has single sim ( if in case it matters to you)",iPhone 11
"Again editing my review after using it for almost 2 weeks, initially, on call volume was soo low that on every call i had to put on speaker but that problem solved itself. So phone is doing great till now . Only thing is charging adapter comes only of 5w which is charging very slow, so had to buy 12w adapter separately. Overall happy with product",iPhone 11
Phone is stuck since last night over herCant go furtherI received this i phone 11 yesterdayIt is not working properlyI guess i got delivered a faulty productNot happy😡,iPhone 11
I received a defected iPhone from amazon there is some space at the back glass it looks like a pasting and manufacturing issue please refund my money,iPhone 11
"I bought the iPhone 11 128gb white and I absolutely love it. The design is insanely good.The truth is the phone comes with an outdated iOS and you must update it. Or else your camera won’t be running normally or the video quality won’t be more than 360p( as it was in my case). But once you do a software update, all the bugs gets fixed.Pros:BatteryCameraDisplayProcessorCons:The charger provided is only of 5W.Also a lot of them seem to say that the phone gets overheated. I thought mine was getting overheated too. But there’a a difference between it being warm and overheating. The truth is it gets warm if you do intense processing. ( The software update took care of that too and I don’t know how).So don’t worry about buying a iPhone here.",iPhone 11
"I’m writing this after one month of using it.Battery 5/5 - so far the best I have seen on a phone both android or iosCamera: 4.5/5 - honestly this is the best camera out of all iPhone till 11 (excluding the pro models). One thing which I was expecting was to control shutter speed atleast in the night mode settings it only gives me pre defined options.Display: 4/5 even though you wont be able to see individual pixels, still would have been a tad better it the pixel density was little more atleast better than xrPerformance: 5/5 No doubt every iphone release breaks the previous record",iPhone 11
"Lil heating issue when u ran to many apps in the background or apps which single handedly use Lots of GPU eg. graphic intensive games or any apps!!! Keep in mind eventually u will come to know don’t worry! and it also hits up when u charge the phone n use them..... So here is some solution....don’t charge n use ur phone unless u necessarily needs it, avoid using back cover if it causes to much heat just remove it for the timing or close the running background apps/ games or switch off ur phone n on again....This are small tips it helped me!!!!....Thankyou guys for reading...if any questions let me will be ready to help u any time and also if we use the same phone cheers🍻🍻 email:-kishekaachumi.ka@gmail.com📩",iPhone 11
"Superb 15hrs delivery 👍🏻First impression is good, I am an Android loverFirst time iPhone different osBest choice 👍🏻After 12 days use update-Battery life is awesome, missing fast charging but overnight charging is enough for next 2 days.I am a naive iphone user very much satisfied with the productAwesome camara solomo videoTill today don't find any con in the phoneIt is really awesomeIgnore negative reviewsIt's all a very good buy 👌🏻👌🏻",iPhone 11
"I generally don't prefer to buy any expensive electronic gadgets like iPhone from any e-commerce portal. I read many negative comments from the reviews section. My plan was to buy iPhone11 128 Gig and particularly Yellow color. I checked the Amazon Sale price and the market price and the difference was 5k INR. I still wanted to buy from the nearest apple authorized retailer but there was some technical issue with the HDFC card and I could not buy it. Then after thinking so much, I tried to buy from Amazon sale on 16th-Oct-2020. The iPhone arrives and I checked the product is fully compliance and 100% genuine. I got full 1 year apple warranty and the product model number. And the best thing is my iPhone is Make in India. I am loving it :) ...",iPhone 11
I had iPhone 6s and it’s been 5+ years now. I decided to go for new one so I will have latest OS and hardware up to date. With market storming with lot of phones and various features I was initially inclined towards non IPhone category but after lot of reviews and seeing quality of those phones my family members have during these years I decided to opt for IPhone 11. Quality is what it matters to me and I do always vote for this.  unless you are a tech freak to try out non IPhones for various features and ready to invest in multiple less costly versions I would recommend IPhone though it costs more for an average middle class person like me. Worth of one time investment.,iPhone 11
"Its my mistake that I bought this iPhone again. My last 6s phone was also a worst phone I had to sold it after a year because there was many issues like hanging, battery backup. Visited Apple service center three times but nothing. Now my Apple 11.. weak network issue have to restart again and again, some time hanged. Less features less apps. High price low features.  Just a standard symbol.",iPhone 11
".They will definitely make fool out of you, I had received defective products with front and back camera issue capturing blurry effects plus instead of airpod sent headset.And no one taking the ownership for replacing, not apple Store, not Amazon, nor vendor",iPhone 11
"Received iPhone 11 on monday. It showed a cosmetic patch( Oval patch) on the lower left corner of the phone on Tuesday morning. Took the phone to iCare centre on wednesday and they confirmed its a faulty product. Contacted Apple Customer Support, they asked to take the issue with Amazon and seller and get it replaced as the device is faulty. I have the service report and images which shows the condition of the display.",iPhone 11
"Very expensive phone compared to the competitors. But iOS and apple’s smoothness and responsiveness can’t be equalled. Happy with the offers provided by Amazon, makes iPhone a possible buy.But one bad experience was the delivery. The package looks crushed and box was torn, outer packing looked untampered. Luckily the phone was not damaged.But when purchasing such an expensive product would expect better handling of the package.There were few negative reviews regarding this, but I thought Amazon would be more careful, But pretty shocked on the package condition.Attached photo shots of the box I got the phone in, real miracle phone survived the transit.",iPhone 11
"First of all ,PROS :The battery performance was really excellent!Unbelievable battery I am really impressed.only 22% battery drained after 1 and half hour continue free fire gaming and 1 hour and 40 min screen on time after gameCONS : reality of salesIt was my first bad experience and worst!The Amazon sended me a used Iphone 11 , where the packaging plastic has 2-3 scratches and inside the box1. ""IPHONE 11 HAS DENTS 1st on the top right corner just near camera and2nd on lower left side on the steel ..I am really disappointed with this service..2. IF YOU are buying Iphone 11 for camera than don't go for it cuz it clicks the worst photo in night and specially in night mode.The picture quality get burst even in normal night photo even if u have a tubelight on still...It only clicks Superb photos in sunlight.And seriously,They forced me to think that the phones ordered during are are really used and worst , from nowadays I won't buy any product during sale and will buy personally from Apple store near me.😔😔😔Really disappointing Amazon.",iPhone 11
"Read a lot of negative reviews regarding buying iphone 11 from amazon but somehow gathered a lot of courage and went forward. Got it for 45k with all the bank offers and this seems to value for money.HEATING ISSUESYou will read a lot of reviews about heating issues. Yes there is some heating issue but that went away after i updated it to ios14 and minor tweaks here and there.BATTERY LIFEI am not a very heavy user so it runs me for about 1.5 days, it would vary upon usage but it would last you for one entire day for sureBACK CAMERAI loved it but am quite disappointed with the front cameraOPERATING SYSTEMIos really makes life so so easy there are so many small small features that apple might not market about but it makes your life so so easy. Its experience is way better than android. I was myself a stock android user but seeing the flexibility with ios, you might not ever switch back",iPhone 11
"The phone is good, i have no issue with phone. But I have purchased iphone 11 on the first day of great Indian festival sale i.e. October 16th. There was a bonus offer on hdfc cards in which they were giving 1250 apay cashback for the transaction more than 30k.On 18th October they have removed the bonus offer on iphone11. Since I have purchased it when the offer was active so I should be eligible for the cashback. My friends who have ordered same product at same time have got cashback on same day.But now they all are saying that we can’t give you the cashback as the offer became inactive on 18th.",iPhone 11
Amazon is worst. Backed out from the cash back which I was supposed to get as a part of bonus offer.. but I will take this matter to court for sure..,iPhone 11
"If u read the review you will know that there are many bad comments. Am also intrigued by it while buying from Amazon, bought during great india sale with a great value for money. Anyway bought it and very satisfied about it. Don’t always made up your mind from some negative, they might have a complaint but it’s always great to buy products from Amazon.This is my 1st iphone and am very happy about the experience. Used more than a week now, here are my review1. I also got a heating problem but that goes away after insane update2. I have checked the product online and its brand new (i have doubt while opening as there is no seal)3. Have been using androids for more than 10yrs and comparing to that the phone is super smooth. U might get to use at first but everything is very simple and ios 14 update is great.4. The battery drains alot at first and also that goes away with the update. It easily last a day with moderate to heavy usage. But you have to ditch the onboard charger, its 5w and took really long time to charge. Usb cable comes with it so u can use your old charger with 18w,27w,30w. But  recommend you buy original fast apple charger.5. Display is also great. Some people might complain that its LCD but if you are not a tech guru yo will not be able to differentiate with the oled display of the pro & max series. So just go with it.6. Had difficulty to tranfer whatsapp data, but that also solve with use of extra software Dr.Fone(but you have to buy it ₹1500 to ₹2000)7. Phone is a little bit heavy so you have to use a good cover so that it might not fall off and crack. I use Spigen cover and for me its the best.8. Some of the apps i use in android are not there. That you have to compromise. But it comes with alot of useful app tool.9. iCloud only have 5gb storage so backing up in cloud is a problem unless u buy extra space. So that’s the reason am going for 128gb, am not using the iCloud and just use the phone storage10. Speaker sound is superb, but am not impressed with the earpods so am still using my Mi bluetooth headset11. Camera sound is annoying, only silent when phone is silent.12. Lastly, i have a great experience of using the phone so am happy that i snub xiaomi, oneplus and samsung in the price range. But it takes a lot of time jumping from android to ios, so it will always be a personal choice",iPhone 11
"I am writing this review exactly after using this product for 1 month. I was skeptical after reading so many negative reviews for this phone but still took a chance to buy. I received the product the very next day with perfect packaging and everything intact. Purchased this product for around 46k after receiving debit card discount. Unboxed it and there was this premium looking phone. I have received all the accessories and a brand new product.I was an android user for past 11 years so using this product was an entirely different experience.Pros:1. Superb processor-  My iphone has not hanged a single time while using regressively. 10+ apps are opened at once still it was buttery smooth2. Amazing camera- The night mode feature of the camera seal the deal with good potrait mode3. Battery lasting for a day- I have always heard from my friends that iPhone doesn't have a good battery back up but this model is lasting for a day which is sufficient4. No heating issue- I have not faced any heating issue till date5. Security- The phone has good features for securing the data and doesn't have unnecessary applicationsCons:1. Charger- The charger provided with this phone is just not sufficient. It takes 3 hours to charge my phone2. No 3.5mm jack- It doesn't have a designated port for connecting your normal headphones. You have to buy expensive jack of 900rs from apple stores3. Slo mo video- The slo mo videos created on the phone creates distorted image and feels like it has been taken by a 2 year old child who cannot hold the phone still.4. Customisation- An android user knows how easy it is to customize their phone according to their preference. You can customise a little on iphone but it is very limited.5. Expensive- iPhone which costs around 50k also needs accessories which are expensive like fast charger for around 1900rs, 3.5mm lightening jack 900rs, icloud storage 75rs/month, apple care etc.Overall I am really impressed with the product and these cons can somewhat be neglected if you're an iPhone user for a long time.",iPhone 11
"Most pathetic and worst service from Amazon , I got a damaged product , iPhone 11 product I received was having damaged microphone and I confirmed the same from apple authorised service centre. After several escalation calls to Amazon customer representative, they committed on call that they will provide replacement of product and later they said Amazon technician will visit my place and inspect the product but the technician did not visit my place and customer representative finally says we will only refund and not replacement. After making the customer wait for 1 week , this is what they come up. Darshit Electronics cheats people by saying they don’t have mobile phone when asked for replacement of a damaged product but they have mobile phones to sell for other customers!!! Low level....Worst experience!!",iPhone 11
Speaker is not in proper working condition. Voice output is burst while playing music. Moreover amazon is not giving me return/refund of product option. Worst experience.,iPhone 11
"Not much to write about an iphone. This is my 1st iphone and i was hesitant to switch to ios from android. But im glad i did. U get the cream experience of everything on the phone , camera ,sound ,screen ,os , security. No comparison with so called android 108mp camera, u get studio quality photos, lastly , amazon deal was cherry on the cake with all accessories. Go fr it !",iPhone 11
"At first I was sceptical about my purchase because I was shifting from Android to iOS but down the line this started to amaze me with most of the things.FEW THINGS worth mentioning are:Cons1. There is no call recording feature, in case you want one to be there.2. There is a 5W charger in box which takes 2.5 hours to charge.3. I couldn't find a way to take my backup from Android to iPhone. Whereas it is super easy to switch from Android to Android with apps like clone phone.4. This phone heats up when you are going to use it for the first time because it generally sets up everything, update software, open apps for the first time but that goes away with regular use.5. It takes time to adjust to iOS if you are a first timer.6. This phone is heavy.7. 60hz is okay if you haven't gone 90hz till now. 😉🤫You haven't used 90hz so you don't even know how it feels.Pros1. Battery backup is super in my usage.2. Camera's were as hyped.3. You will soon blend into iOS system and unlike android devices this UI is specific to a limited number of phones which makes it very refined.4. Wireless charging, Fast charging options.5. IP68 rating a must have.If you prefer Brand over value then go for Apple otherwise if you want value for money then do not spend on any Apple product these are not as good as they say they are. Andorid is leagues ahead in many areas which haven't even touched even pro variants of Apple. Also there is a freedom to do things on android, customize things the way you prefer.",iPhone 11
"I LOVE IT 😌I mean now I can finally understand why everyone is so crazy about iPhones! Even basic apps like WhatsApp and Instagram are so smooth and great to use on this phone unlike my android one. And camera is obviously the BEST!Also the experience really is different on an iPhone and hence I am absolutely in loveeeee!Also worth mentioning - I got this in 49K so this was the best deal for anyone who has not been willing to spend an extra dime on a phone. But now I feel you won’t regret it even if you spend 60-80K on it because it definitely gives you that experience :)About the battery life, it’s not bad but it’s not super great either - however the rest of the things are pretty solid about this phone!",iPhone 11
"Going to lodge a consumer complaint.Faulty camera: when I click picture near bright ligh notice the a faded object similar to tubelight and window in attached images. Defective product received and Amazon is not giving options to replace/return the product. When I placed return request it's giving me Apple customer care number to contact. :( The product packaging was also not safe the iPhone box was placed directly in the polythene bag, no other air cushion or cardboard was used. Really disappointed.",iPhone 11
"No comments on Quality of Apple, this is my 5th iPhone.Only fear was Authenticity and reliability of what exactly is going to be delivered.IT WAS iPhone 11 ONLY and 100% Real, Original and Sealed One...!Thank you Amazon and Appario.",iPhone 11
"Like most of the people i too was worried about the product. What if i get a clone or soap or shampoo etc. Well nothing that happened and a beautiful phone was waiting inside. Packing was normal, nothing extraordinary yet secured one with pin and code thats need to match with the shipment. Thank you AMAZONComing to the phone, well what can i say, the moment i opened the box there was an instant connection, LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT.The phone is incredibly beautiful.Well am an android user for the past 7 years and this being my first ios device it felt nice.Having some problem but i think thats natural, will be getting used to ios very soon.Camera is awesome, night photography , dynamic range, you can never go wrong with this.With A13 bionic chip its still one of the best chip in the market, its smooth like butter.Multitasking is smooth with this. SOUND quality is awesome, you will not complain its crisp and loud.Battery life is good, one can get a full day back up easily with normal usage.The thing that needs to be kept in mind, this phone is slippery and one needs to get a back cover and the screen guard to protect it from fall and scratches.Will be updating more with coming days.......🙂",iPhone 11
"Look at my new phone, and its sweet color!! Thanks to Amazon and the special guy who gifted me this phone! This is a great choice❣️",iPhone 11
"After reading all the negative feedbacks on Appario retail and that too after placing the orders, I was very scared of receving defective or used iphone but after getting both the phones I can say both the phones are new and fantastic. I am really happy & satisfied with the phones.",iPhone 11
"I've been cheated for ₹60000/- for this product by Amazon by sending me a handset which had manufacturing fault. The fault was well pointed out by Apple's authorised service center. While contacting customer service on numerous occasions they made to wait for more tha  a month and after a month they said 'sorry sir, we can't help you'. Handset is useles lying in my cupboard.",iPhone 11
Front camera quality in not good at all.And dual sim doesn’t support in the phone.This is not a dual sim device because only one sim works at once.Like if u r call from primary sim then secondary sim becomes like no service.And the same goes with the secondary simEven u can’t receive messages if u r on the callIf u received a call from unknown number on sim 2And u want to call to that number from sim one that’s not gonna happenFor that u have to save that unknown number then only u will be able to call on that number,iPhone 11

"I have received a defective Product,When I switched it on I got some vertical lines displayed in center of the screen.I have tried to replace the product,But no response from Amazon , Simply says we need to contact Iphone Customer care.I don't know just received one day phone,I have to keep on spending my time to iphone customer care.This is a bad experience which I have ever got in Amazon.

"Have been an iPhone user for a while. Moving from the 6s, this is the perfect upgrade.- Great display- Great battery life- Camera is nice too- ios 14 makes this even betterAt the price point offered on amazon, this is the perfect upgrade",iPhone 11
First i want to say about amazon look there are lot of roumors about fake product and all but amazon is really trusted company from years and I personally experienced it how the packing of my iphone 11 good is and customer service provided. Now Let’s come to product see if you thinking about switching on android to ios then absolutely go for it really very good experience of apple. worth product and also some peoples worried about LCD display panel bt believe me the display of iPhone 11 is just amazing even you can’t notice that you are using LCD panel that  was I experience from shifting k20’s super amoled display to 11’s lcd panel and about battery no need it’s enough for daily users thank you amazon.,iPhone 11
"I have purchased this phone from amazon praying that i works fine as i receive the product as there is no return or replacement policy applicable for this. I am very fortunate that i received the product on scheduled delivery date in perfectly working condition and a most importantly a genuine one.Coming to the performance - i upgraded from iphone 6, so i felt the performance is super fast considering the 4GB ram. The camera quality is top notch. FaceId also works in low/dim light and is super fast and detects if your eyes are open/closed before unlocking the phone.The aspect i liked the most was was the notification message security, the message doesnt show up until u authenticate with faceid.The screen size is really cool.The downside i felt was with the thickness of the phone, my iphone 6 is super thin and this one felt little more bulkier. Felt even more bulkier after i added the case and screen gaurd.The battery backup is quite good, i got a whole day with wifi on and with some videos on youtube and calls over whatsapp and cellular n/w.Over all i give the 3.5 out of 5 considering the cost and the features it comes with. But remind yourself thats it an IPHONE !! You have to be ready to pay that much for it considering the quality and security that comes with it. ❤️ Apple 🍎",iPhone 11
One word reviewBESTI once used it for 11 days straight with single charge was on standby mostly and listened 3-5 songs each day for 11 days.I upgraded from IPhone se to this and was amazed with the performanceThis iPhone is future proof and will last you for foreseeable future just go for it,iPhone 11
I received a defective phone the calls and speaker sound is distorted... have raised a complaint with Apple assistant n they hv asked me to observe my phone for 24 hrs ... now I just blew money n here I m waiting .... very disappointed,iPhone 11
"Despite being a serious android user , after reading and researching a lot about iPhones , finally I decided to bought it , and to my surprise it turns out pretty well , yes the packing of Amazon was good but not up to the marks as this item would be considered costly item and so the packing should have been much better, the delivery time was good and intact I received it before only so full marks on the delivery process. Regarding the phone it is quite a thing to catch the eye with it’s mint green color and super amazing screen and the camera is a beast, the built quality is top notch and you will feel the sturdy product. Yes it’s little difficult to shift from android to iOS but once you get a hang of it then you will start loving it .If you really wanna buy a good phone with statisfaction then you can buy this.",iPhone 11

Great phone... Great deal.. but Amazon needs to train their customer support better.. i ordered the phone on 16oct and got it delivered on 4th nov despite being a prime member.. despite multiple calls none of the customer support could figure out the reason for delay when atlast one person said the issue is between the payment bank and amazon without any fault of mine.. and one mail to the bank resolved the issue.. lot of hassles could hv been avoided if the customer support was trained appropriately regarding the error codes they are seeing on the system..very disappointed..,iPhone 11

"Its a really fun device to use and the battery life is quite good however the fun stops when you need to charge it. It just takes too long to charge on the Apple Charger that’s included in the box. The display is really good too, I had used an S8 before coming from OLED, it doesn’t matter the experience is amazing you won’t miss OLED because of this.  Speakers are great, color is awesome! Feels so good without the case i Have to use it without the case. Dual sim is working great too.",iPhone 11
"Writing this review after 7 days of use. I have previously owned an iPhone 6s then switched to poco F1 and now iPhone 11.Pros: 1. Best battery life in an iPhone  - 3110 mAh2. Beautiful 3 cameras - 12 mps all (see attached photos - taken very casually )3. Ios 14 so smooth (4gb ram)4. Dual speakers sound really punchy.5. Apple face id is amazing and quick.6. Apple security and apps are so well optimised.7. Dual sim (e sim and physical).8. Easily synced all my data and got my all my folders and layout exactly as I had it on my iPhone 6s with the all the custom settings of the same.9. iMessage is very cool if you use it.10. No battery issue or heating as I read previously online, battery easily lasted a day or more.11. Bigger Lock Screen button than before (coming from iphone 6s)12. Premium feel phone13. Its an iphone14. Good resale valueCons:1. In face id you always have to swipe up physically to unlock phone (in my previous phone poco f1 it automatically after detecting my face would unlock and there was no need to swipe up)2. Minor software limitations as compared to android3. Apple original 3.5mm cable will cost you 1000 rs4. Little heavy after putting on spigen case (go for basic cases if you prefer a lighter phone)5. You cannot disable the setting that when the lock screen side button is pressed it will end the call if you press it. You have to refrain from pressing it while on call.Conclusion:I would personally rate this at 9.5/10If you like ios go for apple, if not go for android, it’s as easy as thatAnd as for me, I’m very much satisfied with this phone, got it at 55k.",iPhone 11
"iPhone - the name is enough to guarantee buttery smooth performance, with years of guaranteed OS updates (Android, looking at you. I struggled to get the monthly updates for weeks on your own brand Pixel phones, forget about the flashy Samsung and Xiaomi/OnePlus etc.). Amazing camera, no bloatware or selling customer data to third parties (again Android, looking at you. You give the OS for free and make the customer the product to push ads for revenue). After years of being a committed Android user, from the time Nokia/Microsoft stopped making Windows smartphones, for almost 6+years, finally decided being taken for a ride by Google/Android. Well, was using the iPhone 6s for about an year along with my Google Pixel 2 XL, but now Apple iPhone is my only daily driver, and the way things are looking between Apple and Google and how they are focused on business in India, its going to be an iPhone always for me, for the foreseeable future.",iPhone 11

"Brought this iPhone on Amazon for 54999rs on 18th October 2020. Good price for the 128GB variant. Using it for a week, really awesome mobile, performance,  camera all are perfect. Took this mobile to the apple store and verified  it's a apple product. It came with headphones  and charger  within the box.Really good for this price. I'm really happy.Guys always go for the Amazon fulfilled sellers. Saw lots for negative  reviews on social media  for both amazon and flipkart selling fake iPhones. All are not true. If you have any doubts go and check you device with apple store. See my uploaded picture what's comes in the box. , it will help.",iPhone 11
"Right choice to upgrade for iPhone 6/6s/7 user. Battery life is excellent. Presently it lasts for 36 hours for me.Camera- one of the best, if compared with other brand.Only cons- the phone box does not contain any separate connector to connect the wired earphone. You have to use the same earphone which came with the box. Otherwise go wireless.",iPhone 11
"Great discount purchased during offer. Earphone and charger included along with data cable. Secure delivery. Packaging was not good but iPhone cover itself is rock hard which can protect the inside item very well. Camera quality is awesome, Night mode even better, Great look, mine is purple, suits both gender. Super speed function, face unlock very sensitive, front camera very good. Only 1 physical sim can be supported, and another e-sim can be installed if required. Battery life not as expected, I used to charge atleast once every day. No screen guard included. Many free android apps are not free in ios.",iPhone 11
I just upgrade my iphone6 to iphone11 and its a game changer for me...Prons:-Camera:- Best in class no one can beat itBattery:- Good battery life at one chargeSoftware:- A13 Bionic which make this phone super fast. Best in industryFace Id:- No one can give you fast face unlock. Apple nailed it againLooks:- Premium Phone with Premium look. Black colour is like JawdropCons:-Charger:- still 5W chargerScreen:- No HD display. only 720pNotch:- Very thick Notch which make this phone oldWeight:- Lil bit heavyOverall:- 8/10 Worth buy it,iPhone 11
"If u have points and planning for not changing phone 2to 4 year that iPhone 11 is best optionIt’s my first purchase of iPhone from one plus 5T i am also thinking about its price but after some coupons and amazon icici credits point and cash back, it’s make me happyAbout iphone11Processor is awesome there is no lagCamera and haptic touch is very goodI seen heating problems in some comment I think those people don’t know how to use mobile data optionBattery performance and charging also awesome as campare to XRIt’s display very good and mr/miss siri is equal to alexa relative.So if you are looking for premium phone with best performance go for it and don’t worry about features like 5G.in india 4G services still not good and 5G will take 3 yr to fully operational",iPhone 11
"Honestly the feel of phone, colors in it is extremely standard. This may not have OLED screen but honestly the quality is top-notch. However if it had OLED, it would be much more battery efficient.This is first time for me to have an iphone as recently I switched from android. I am switching from k20 pro that had OLED and 90 Hz display. Honestly 60 Hz is the only thing on this phone that bugged me else screen is brilliant. Gaming is fire smooth.Camera is too damn good. Extremely detailed to be precise. I have never used the camera of a phone before this much. Night mode pictures are clearly to fall in love with. If you buy quick charger you are then set to use it. Battery is really good but 5W charger is definitely not helping, earphones are also good.",iPhone 11
"I’ve always been a loyal android user, have used only high end android phones - nexus , Samsung galaxy series,  S9 plus and the like. I was very apprehensive about shifting to iOS as I was told android is much more flexible and I will not be able to adjust to Apple. My phone got delivered before time, I charged it and started using it by afternoon. Took a couple of hours for data transfer and by evening I was completely in love with this phone. Was amazed by the interface and no nonsense whatsoever kind of vibe from this phone. I also got it at a very reasonable price from amazon shopping festival. Thank you Amazon and Apple !",iPhone 11
I am not impressed by the camera as it should be considering phones like Oneplus and google pixel 4. The night mode is good but other than this the camera does not have much to offer.Battery is okay.Processor is good. The size of iPhone 11 is 6.1inch which is more than pro variant.Overall average phone as compared to Oneplus and Google Pixel 4.,iPhone 11
I was very happy when I received my iphone 11 package and this is my first apple product. After opening i came to know the charger not working. I didn't expect this from amazon and customer care leave it to our fate. Don't buy an expensive product like iphone on amazon particularly during sale. The best thing to do is to buy from an apple store.,iPhone 11
"Camera is okay but not that great as it was advertised and we can not say it as the world’s best camera in any smartphone because Rear camera is more than good but the selfie camera is not much good. It has a quality which we can get in ₹30,000-40,000 range smartphone. So I will give only 3 out of 5 star for the camera and for remaining other things like processor, performance, battery life etc. “these are just great” and will give 5 out of 5 stars rating!!I’m just unhappy for the camera only!And I think this is the most unbiased review!",iPhone 11
I bought iPhone 11(128GB) on the same day of delivery when I used it for 10-20 mins only it started heating...Again after some time when I tried the heating issue was there...I am trying to contact for refund but there is no response from Amazon...This is the worst experience ...Never buy expensive products from Amazon....I need my money back.,iPhone 11
"First thing Face ID is impressive and stands out , Everything else is on the same lines as some of the Nokia Phones released on Windows and Android platforms. Nokia's Pure display is way ahead. Audio Quality is somewhat better in iPhone11 may be on par to some Music Express Phones of Nokia from past. iOS14 widgets (Widget Apps are very limited) are a straight copy of Live tiles on Lumia Phones of 2012 - 2016 .. Nokia was ahead of time. Data Security is good on iphone but don't forget that NYPD (New York Police department ) used Nokia Windows Phones for secure communication during its time. Even Nokia Android Phones are most secure compared to others on Android Platform except Pixel.Camera : Selfie Camera is average and my Nokia 9 takes superb selfie images although the SW in Nokia is too slow,Main Camera is an example of better coupling of Apple HW and SW which give some of the best images. Nokia 9 too takes a professional grade images but at the cost of slow SW and over exposure in some light conditions.Felt iphone 11 bit broader by 2 mm to master the usage in one hand , also not providing justice to its interface which has flexibility to use in one hand in certain use cases. But still menu navigation requires both hands.. Which is opposite to Android 10 Gesture Navigation.After two weeks usage i found bugs in Siri Assistant - Fails to get directions for some places on Apple Maps and also on Google maps --- Spending big money for this silly bug is super waste.Being typical Indian user reluctant to pay 20 Rupees for a ringtone , Wallpaper on App store - Lets me down.Whatsapp Chats cant backed up from Android device for free .. Have to spend atleast 1500 INR through 3rd party SW by risking your data which iam not interested.Overall not a good Value proposition ... Hope same with iphone 12 too. End am not cribbing too as i got this piece of gadget for 40k after cashback and selling my old device outside Amazon for better price.IMO - Go for either Pixel or Nokia or Samsung or Oneplus for peaceful experience except others like Vivo, Oppo , Mi , realme which are bloatware junks and shows their colors within in 6 months of usage.",iPhone 11
"After upgrading from iPhone 6 it feels quite good to use a flagship model like this. Camera quality is awesome, battery backup is way better compared to the previous models of iPhone, A13 Bionic chip is really powerful, if you’re a gamer you must own this device, PUBG,Asphalt etc runs smoothly in this device but the device heats up while playing games. We’ll go for the pro or pro max model if you wish to have a telephoto lens along with OLED display along with silver coating which feels premium, else you may go for this . I really welcome android users to have this device , it’s literally a beast in all aspects",iPhone 11
"This is the one brand for which i was waiting for four years, literally i purchased this mobile only for brand, many of them have a dream to buy a apple from own money as i also had and it took me four years, After the use of more then ten days am posting this review am very much happiee with the performance of this beauti,, especially the camera is the biggest pros",iPhone 11
"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.


   Quality not adequate. Camera quality is worst. Video recorder doesn't have pause button hence you need to buy extra app and after spending money on that app you're gonna get cheap quality videos. I couldn't return because of limitations. But it's not worth spending 66k for this phone. My one plus 5t has far far better quality of camera and has all required features. In short I would like to tell that I'm extremely disappointed after purchasing this phone",iPhone 11
Very good pic quality / Battery life is bad / Iphone best,iPhone 11
"1st time bought an apple product, fully different experience. The OS is not user friendly like android but it's interesting.The camera quality is quite impressive. The night camera is also good, but there is a little issue which I was not supposed, and ie. when you move ur hand or any non-living object it blurs the image and I was supposing that iPhone will fix it... But the sensor is very good... face detection is awesome...",iPhone 11
Worst mistake of my life. I have brought this product for my feyonce and my trouble started from that day onwards. Mobile display was faulty and when i reached apple store they kept the iphone for 1 week and replaced the display. After 1 day same issue happened again still the same cycle. Its 3rd time that same issue is coming.,iPhone 11
"The iPhone 11 is probably the best value for money phone for people who desire flagship phones from known brands, until of course, the iPhone 12 is launched. The phone has great battery life, and a fantastic camera. The Chip is extremely fast and, as always, the iOS is probably the most user friendly UI available. The purchase experience was good, i got a reasonable discount, even though the no cost EMI option was only available on thee Amazon Pay credit card. I do feel that amazon is probably trying to encourage of their ‘in-house’ card and hence discourage the no cost EMI on other cards.",iPhone 11
"Camera was not working properly there was a lot of noise in indoor photos .The seller here appario rtl LTD is having issues with the phone I don't whether they are selling authentic phones .I got it replaced ,but the replacement unit also had same problem ,so just got it refunded. Think 1000 times before buying from Appario LTD seller.",iPhone 11
"Where do I start. This is a big leap for Apple.I upgraded from XR to this. At first I didn’t feel much of a difference but after using it for more than a month and simultaneous use of XR and 11, I can say this phone is a big improvement. Small nuances like screen quality, camera improvement, battery management, speed makes this a really good companion. Forget the concerns of losing battery during the day. This lasts for good two days with light use and would easily last a day with heavy use. Playing have games on this is a bliss as well.",iPhone 11
"I am writing this review because before deciding to buy one for myself, I was going through the reviews and there were a quite a few of them mentioning that people should avoid buying an iPhone from Amazon.However, since I had a gift coupon from Amazon and Prime sale was offering me a superb deal, I decided to go for it.I got the hone delivered the very next day. Packaging was good, however, expected a cardboard packaging, which was not there. Checked and verified my phone. It was a new one. No heating issue. Everything is working fine.The phone itself is great, superb camera, looks good, excellent battery life. Truly worth the price especially if you are switching from Android.",iPhone 11
The day when I received the iphone11 it's hearing speaker is not working while receiving call and while calling someone it's making some beeping sound I contact with customer care but there was no response so pls don't buy things from amazon they are selling duplicate products to customers so pls don't waste ur savings with Amazon,iPhone 11
"Upgraded from iPhone 6s, I am totally happy with my new iPhone 11. Everything meets perfection on Apple as always, and the Camera is exceptional. Especially when it is low light. I was amazed seeing the result and the best part of the camera I liked is, when you compare the camera taken photo with reality, it looks almost similar. That means no unnecessary color grading or corrections are made on the picture, the result looks very nice and real. You can do color corrections later with the app.Conclusion: If you're a camera person who wants to take more realistic pictures or raw images and cannot afford iPhone 12 now, go for 11. You won't regret, I promise.PS: The images I have attached are at extreme low light condition. In other words, with naked eyes, it was much more darker.",iPhone 11
"It’s a monster. But a good one though. A true beast among phones. Awesome camera, battery life, sound, processing and face recognition. Me, and my spouse, both are using iPhone 11 and we both are real happy with the product. She has got red one and mine is black. Totally satisfied with iPhone 11 and got at nice rate. No issues till now. Thanks to Apple and Amazon. A perfect purchase if you have got enough money 😈",iPhone 11
"To start off i must say i was really scared ordering after seeing such negative reviews. But to my delight all is well! The phone is original and has a valid serial number. I have upgraded from iphone 8 plus to iphone 11. I feel there is immense battery improvement as that was a major issue with 8 plus.It has a bigger screen than 8 plus but has a small overall body! So, i you prefer bigger phones you may go for 11 Pro Max. But otherwise at this price it is amazing and overall i am happy to have upgraded from 8 Plus!",iPhone 11
"Everything is fine as expected from Apple. Camera is really good. The processor is fast. COD runs smoothly even at highest resolution with highest frame rates. Display is good, though its not an amoled screen or O-led, but the screen is bright enough under sunlight.  The charger provided is a 5watt charger, which takes around 2 hour 30 minutes to charge the battery from 15% to 100%. User has to be a little careful with the battery. Heavy user will have to charge the device twice a day. After using Anroid for all these years it actually quite interesting to use an iOs device. Security on the device has to be mentioned. The face lock works seamlessly, even in pitch dark conditions. Everytime an app is downloaded, face recognition is must. Sharing of photos and documentaries is actually not tough these days with so many applications available. I am having a great time with my 1st ever Iphone. I might not go back to anroid device again if this device runs good for the next 3 years. Thank you Amazon for such quick delivery within 24hours. The seller Appario Retail private ltd has done a great job in terms of packaging and on time delivery.",iPhone 11
I got Defective Piece from Amazon.  Nobody helping me with resolving issue. Total waste of money And Time,iPhone 11
"I am first time purches iphone11 64 gb but very poor product and amazon delever to defective pecie, thus phone is very heat and charge also, i am very disappointed this servise i am never buy to any product to thoroughly amazon plzz all iphone user don’t purchase online plzz very bed product to sell to amazon",iPhone 11
"Pros -1. All the benefits of an iPhone. (Superb ios experience, smoothness, speed, touchscreen etc etc etc)2. In this time when smartphones giving backup of 20+ hrs in a single charge are considered a good one. This phone has the best battery life in iPhones till now. It easily gives 36 hrs battery life with normal usage.3. Sound is loud.Cons:-1. Extremely slow charging:- it take approximately 3 hrs to charge this phone from 10% to 100%. You have to buy a fast charger separately. In the pack they were giving 5W charger. But i think with newer models you need to buy the brick separately as they are giving only the charging cable. You can get 20W power brick from apple website for ₹1900. That should solve this slower charging issue for you.2. Heavyweight- this phone is pretty big and heavier to hold.Iphone x - 174 gmsIphone xs - 177 gmsIphone 11 - 193.3 gmsIphone 12 - 162.4 gms",iPhone 11
I don't know why people have bad things to say about the product or the delivery.IPhone 11 is a beastAlso the product is genuineDon't give a second thought.,iPhone 11
"So, I got this phone on June 14, 2020. First impressions - It is a tad too big to my liking and very slippery. A Spigen rugged case is highly recommended.Apple should start giving different skins and themes to customise the phone. The battery life is awesome only if you keep it in low power mode. Else it will not last even eight hours. In battery saver, you can literally watch six three-hour movies. In short, a full day's work of keeping FB, Twitter, Instagram, Gmail, YouTube active can be accomplished.The charging is very slow. For a full charge from 2%, you end up wasting 3.5hrs. Apple is doing the height of chindigiri now by not providing earphones as well as the power adapter. What if I am an all-new introduction to the Apple ecosystem.I am not a fan of the camera or perhaps I am a bad photographer. Unfortunately I don't have any images on me. Lost my phone 😢. Booked another 11 though during the Great Indian Festival.",iPhone 11
The camera quality is too bad. I just purchased this phone in last month but without any physical damage phone started working improperly. Pictures quality is also not that good. The same phone I had purchased in month of September from Mall and that is working totally fine till now. But I suggest to all that go for real time physical shopping for this phone. Without any reasons I'm facing too many problems. So I suggest to buy it from market. So you can easily check everything about phone.,iPhone 11
"Handsdown to the best vfm apple product right now on the sale. I was so skeptical reading the negative reviews from the seller named - apparioBut then eventually things were pretty cool.Got it delivered within a day.And the box was sealed with no dents or anything crap which you might have read in the previous reviews. ✌🏻 Also if you wanna jump to the ios ecosystem, you may opt for xr which was available for 36k during the sale, or even low for the SE2These products won't disappoint you ! 💯💯💯",iPhone 11
"Product : iPhone 11 (White, 128GB)Occasion : Amazon's Great Indian Festival, 2020Price : ₹49,999Seller : Apparel Retail Private Ltd., Tamil Nadu Key Points on Amazon :1) Received it by one and half day.2) No damaging or used product(Its Brand New).3) Warranty got applied only after booting up the device.4) I was worried about online fraud, but thank god this purchase isn't one.First impressions  &  Key points:1) Very premium phone.2) Loaded with features.3) Camera performance is good.4) Haven't tested battery yet, but seems to be good.5) Face ID is super fast.6) Glad to receive accessories[Feeling sad for people seeing it in coming years ;)]7) Back panel is extra prune to fingerprints. So, case is highly recommended.8) Same with front display. Suggest you to apply a tempered glass.Overall I'm satisfied with my purchase and impressed with Amazon and Seller for this experience.PS: These are 1st impressions, I'll be reviewing it again.",iPhone 11
I purchased this phone during Oct festive sale and I am happy with the product.If u wanna buy the phone I am assuming u have gone through tons of reviews and videos.Everything is good until I checked GPS. It’s not working properly each and every time. I am residing in Bangalore but my location is based in Romania😂And still I am unable resolve the issue. Hope a software update will fix this bug.,iPhone 11
"I never go by reviews. I have done intensive research differentiating between android and iOS. I previously was a big fan of Symbian OS. No wonder the most robust system in those days. Then, android & Windows took over Symbian monopoly.I was accustomed with symbian but had no choice to buy Sony Experia smart phone as Nokia got dissapeared. I somehow wasnt comfortable with Android stock apps and the way the overall file system.I then decided to try iOS and I never regretted to ever switch back to Android.",iPhone 11
"My Face ID recognition is not working. Spoke with Apple customer care, their instructions didn't work, later went to the iPhone service center too,  They said it might be a hardware problem, and asked us to return the phone since I bought it today, But I can't able to return the mobile in amazon. They said 30 days replacement warranty. But when I choose the replacement option, they ask me again to talk with the customer care. poor service amazon",iPhone 11
Writing this review after careful consideration. I am happy with the product it is as expected from Apple.I will review this as per my experience from Amazon(service) and iPhone(product). I will tell write what I liked and what I didn't.Pros1. Professional delivery.2. Product received as described.3. Delivery received before the mentioned/dispatch date.4 Received a made in India device.Cons1. Amazon had prime days where it advertised the product for a price and changed the price the very same day.I couldn't purchase on 6th cause of their payment issues and on 7th they changed the price. Also the delivery dates were changed and had to opt for prime to buy the device. When I bought the prime subsription. The price had raised for the device. hence the discount nullified. As there is a discount on HDFC from Day 1 of 5000/6000.2. The day i had ordered the device the dispatch date changed to 1 week being a prime member in prime days. The second day it was changed to next day delivery and still I did not receive the device. I may not understand the delivery management but felt cheated.3. The prime membership that I was forced (by marketing strategy) to take was of no use to me for the product delivery in future purchases as well that month.Conclusion:If I had not fallen for the marketting of Amazon I would have given it a five star or at least a four star rating.,iPhone 11
"Pros :-Great camera! The best ever. You don’t need to word hard to get the best shot. The image stabilisation is brilliant. The improved version gives you a perfect wide angle shot with option to increase or decrease depth in portrait mode.-LCD screen has no issues in performance and you will not notice any difference between OLED and this one. Bezels are visible but you will probably learn to live with it.-Blazing fast! This is the fastest processor/chipset so no lags in multiple app usage-Improved Battery which runs for good 15-18 hrs on medium usage-Games run insanely well with high end graphics-Wireless Charging-Beautiful design and ease of usage with a good sound reproduction from speakers than earlier iPhonesCons:-Wifi is slow and for some reason it doesn’t agree with 5Ghz band (which is the latest wifi version) so if you have 2.4 GHz then cool-Night Mode in camera sucks. One Plus 8 easily wins, even one plus 6T outperforms it in night mode.-Slow Charger in box still 5Watt so you have to buy another fast charger if u need. That is also slow ans gives you about 70% charge in 30 mins while on one plus you can get it to 90%-No 5G but still usable device as it will receive at least next 4 software updates-60Hz screen refresh rate. This is not a problem but Samsung and One Plus have upgraded to 90-120 and I don’t know why apple is being stupid on this-No screen guard or silicone back cover included in box-Best Photos need ambient light and poor performance in low light conditions. Tone becomes warmer and photos look more Yellow/Pale-Some useless pre loaded apps about 5-10Gb-True Black Experience is not there. OLED users who wanna switch might find it less pleasing.",iPhone 11
I have upgraded from Iphone 7 to this & it’s really COOL 😎. Just go for it amazing camera specially the night mode and portrait. Just to add one thing  it’s battery dies in one whole day after full charge. Though it depends you use this as personal or professional. I use this as professionally with high no of calls per day using this personally battery life I think will be much much higher as compared.,iPhone 11
It heats up quickly from the first day. I tried a lot to reduce the heating issues but it still present even in normal uses also. Lot of time called the amazon customer care but their reply was disappointing and cut the calls during the conversations. Heating issue still on after the updates and reset ma phone.,iPhone 11
"I recieved my order in 2 days. Thanks to Amazon for the swift delivery. I have been using apple for almost 3 years and trust me if you are upgrading from a old iphone then iphone 11 is the best option to go. The camera is the best and the sound quality is super excellent. I am sure that you will fall for the red colour one, maybe thats my preference.",iPhone 11
"Genuine review(not paid): I have been using the Android system all my life and this is my first iPhone. Initially, I was thinking that this phone is quite expensive but using this phone for almost 2 months, I can say that it is totally worth the premium price.The features and the user experience is amazing. The entire Apple ecosystem and the sync between different devices are remarkable. Helps me achieve more in my daily life.I am just hoping that Apple doesn't intentionally slow this phone down by software updates. It happened to me earlier when I bought an Ipad mini which started to slow down after 2 years of usage.Thanks.",iPhone 11
"I was a bit skeptical about the mixed reviews in Amazon. And fake iPhones getting delivered from Amazon in youtube. I ordered from the seller Darshita Electronics, this is my review after a week of use.The iPhone is genuine without a doubt thanks to Darshita electronics for that, and i got a 1 year in box warranty too, confirmed this from the apple care website.This is a great phone with minimal flaws.The build quality is very premium as you expect it from apple, The Videos are great, very impressed wit the night mode for photos. Performances is great all of the apps works flawlessly without a single lag. Face id works perfect in dark roomsThe small features apple provides like the keypad tone, ios14 features, shortcuts, siri and most importantly i don’t have to share my data with google you have a secure iCloud for that all this and more made me love this phone completely.The cons are the charger, it charges pretty slow with the 5w charger almost 3 hrs. And apple pushing you to buy their product’s like the apple watch or the airpods or a better fast charger in that case.Since the earphone in the box and charger have lightning cable you can't use earphones while charging.If you’re looking for a 1st time apple experience i suggest you go for it you will never regret.Peace",iPhone 11
"Lured by the big discount during the sale bought an iPhone 11 128GB black phone. Extremely disappointed with amazon! You guys sent a phone with faulty screen! And there was no option of contacting customer care. All attempts were leading to Apple customer care details. Finally upon contacting the Apple customer care, they advised to take it nearest Apple service centre. The service centre was reluctant asking to contact amazon, as it was bought from amazon. The service centre guys mentioned that they have had many such compliants with regards to issues with iPhones delivered from amazon! Hope you guys are not delivering substandard and poor quality phones under the guise of discounted products!I would be henceforth very skeptical buying any high value products from amazon! Sorry to say this!",iPhone 11
"It is an iPhone. No other words required. I like the battery life but I still think they could have made it better. No complaints though, have been using it for a month now and the performance has been awesome. Cannot compare it to an android. It is a matter of taste/preference and now that I have switched to IOS, I am not willing to leave it and switch back to android. Probably because iOS is pretty simplistic, just the way I like it.iPhones are not worth 70k I guess but I got it for 53K which is definitely worth it. It is good if you get an iPhone for around 50. Hence I decided to buy this instead of the new 12",iPhone 11
"Worth buying! It’s an extraordinary device! The only flaw I would say is the display! If you compare side by side to Amoled displays this display will feel dull! But it’s more than enough for a smartphone m! The the purpose of smartphone are many not just media consumption! And hey guys all this will be noticed only when you compare it!What I say is don’t compare! Coz this iPhone is far far better in its performance and usage irrespective of LCD display! ..especially the photos, video recording, editing, ppt, browsing, everything you throw at it! It does with ease.. an EASY YES for this mobile..",iPhone 11
"You won’t be able to use this phone when you use it outside and if the temperature is more than 29 degree Celsius, your phone will heat because you will b using phone data. You are only allowed to use inside and when you have AC, and connected to WiFi. Definitely not for the temperature in India. Forget about summer, better you don’t take phone outside in summers 😂.",iPhone 11
"I have been using Apple products from last 4 years and yes the experience was amazing.Iphone 11 was purchased only due to my past experience but unfortunately its not a good product in fact its a bad choice.There is a hell of problems associated with Dual sim features and that cannot be resolved(in a nut shell) If you have consistent use of dual sim numbers forget apple devices including ipad. Comparing experience only few of the camera features can be rated as excellent otherwise its  better to avoid iphone dual sim models.The major problem faced by me is whenever I am using wifi the network of the carriers (airtel/jio) goes off... so in other sense I cannot use wifi , also if I make a call from one number the other network is off so if I am on a official call all my personal contacts /family members cannot call me....other than this for sending text messages there is only one default number and you have to go to setting for using other number for imessages. It may seem that apple does not visualize such issues as major problem but for people like me I have to again shift to the android version .Please also keep a note of the features provided by apple many times I have the feeling that apple devices are slow as I have been using android one also . Only 2 -3 features are still unique with apple that's its software & camera features. So in future it would be hard choice to choose apple devices especially Iphone.",iPhone 11
At first i was so suspicious to order it from amazon after reading so many negative reviews.... but then also i take a risk to order it from amazon . It got delivered in 4 days and i am completely satisfied with amazon products.  It was a new phone not refurbished or clone . And it gives a proper warranty of 1 year .Returning to product ...At starting i feel heating while setting up my phone ... i was earlier using Poco F1 so i feel some heat due to it’s glass back ... but it was not much ... slightly warmer at back because of that glass back .Battery life is very good ... but very slow charging.Camera is awesome u will love the images ... even in low light .Gaming performance is brilliant.Cone is that it’s display is slightly dull ... as its just ips lcd display.Overall u will enjoy using this phone,iPhone 11
"Apple - another masterpiece. Camera is so real followed by powerful processor. Such a superior experience so far. Hope this continues!Amazon - Delivery in less than 24 hours, you just nailed this prime thingi. Although i followed up, but you fullfilled your promise as usual. Kudos and thanks for delivering the device in such a perfect way... thank you...",iPhone 11
"Don't buy the iPhone on Amazon. They get from vendors who sell cheap pieces or pieces that have issues. I bought it on 21st Oct and since 3 days the mic is not working. I have tried to reach out to Apple support, they are asking me to get it serviced. When we buy a brand new phone, within two weeks it goes for service! what does that mean??, did we get a refurbished one or a faulty one? Better to buy at Stores.",iPhone 11
I bought an iPhone11 25 days before and the day before yesterday my volume key stopped working. Amazon will take returns only up to 7days from purchase. Now I've submitted for a replacement to planetcare. They say there is a possibility to reject the replacement if a third party spare change had occurred. Don't trust amazon sellers on high-priced products especially iphones. buy it from the apple store.,iPhone 11
"What to say, it “The Iphone” best in class top notch.Its one month today exactly I have been using this I would like to rate this product like1- camera 5/52- battery 5/53- screen 4/54- sound 5/5These 5 points i feel are the most imp points in order to rate any phone out there. I just love using it this is my 3 rd iphone in 6 years and yet it didn’t disappoint me. If you want to buy a phone inside 55k this is the perfect fit for you. Privacy is the best in class not like other they still and sell you data. Its the best!!!!!!😍",iPhone 11
"After watching a video of youtuber name rapha.. I wanted to cancel the order initially but due to offer I compromised... But still a tension environment created in me, and I hope for the best... After watching several videos in youtube I  checked my mobile A to z for finding any issue and originality.... By God grace I received original mobile....initially I noticed a warming after settings it's very very normal and cool. Super battery standby unbelievable literally.The Updateing with a mobile hotspot will screws you better connect to orginal wifi for update. Picture quality superb as usual. I only prefer White color when it is apple... Seller is good... But next time I won't buy apple products in online. I don't want this tension atmosphere... Say no to online when it is apple..",iPhone 11
"Thanks to Amazon's ""The Great Indian Shopping Festival"" I got the best deal for this phone compared to other sites. I think I was one of the early bird to avail this great offer. It would be stupid to give a phone review for a year old phone but for me it's perfect piece of machine at a very reasonable price. Special mention goes to the early delivery made by the Amazon courier service.Thank you Amazon for this wonderdul deal.",iPhone 11
"Stop fooling people by using marketing gimmick, Earpod and Airpod is same thing but wire earphone is completely different from Earpod. Product you are giving with iphone is earphone and not Earpod so do not market it as if you are providing Earpod. Stop fooling Consumer! :-(",iPhone 11
No fingerprint,iPhone 11
"I think Apple's phones that make it different.This is my first phone.  I have never used Apple's phone before.It is known only after using it.I don't understand that the other company makes 64 megapixel cameras, but Apple's 12mp gives a good picture, why?",iPhone 11
"The best phone in the market for this price. I bought the phone before lockdown  and I am thankful to god that it proved to be one of the best decisions I took. You do not have to worry about anything, just charge it and the battery doesn’t not drain out for at least 12 hours. I am in back to back office calls for more than 8 hours. So this product is worth every Penny invested in it. This is my 3rd iPhone...iPhone 3GS, iPhone 6 and then iPhone 11. I change it every 4-5 years and must say the old phone still support most of the apps i have in this. This is a great investment if you value your money and time.",iPhone 11
"Batter life is very good compared with older version's of Iphone. I am charging once in two days :-)Face id is too good, it is working in dark also and its seamless.Siri is slowed after upgrading to ios14Apple carplay is awesome, there is no lag. And you can play the songs, send messages through SIRI while driving.Camera is verygood , and we can change the portrait modes after taking the pictures. Pictures in night are not effective comparing with daylight.",iPhone 11
"I hav a bad review this time with Amazon I ordered iPhone 11 on 16th and delivered on 18th October Sunday, my complain is against order which was written in box EarPods with lightning connector I have not this item in box it was empty, I dint raised dowbt first bec wen it was delivered I was out of town by evening on same day, I returned back after 3 days but suddenly I came to know yesterday that in Amazon free EarPods was given then I chkd my box bec my Frnd came and Told me yes in my box also written same. So I called today customer care I was given horrible reason stating its passed 10 days but actual reason wen u took money ull don’t hesitate but then why now?. So now I have decided if Amazon will not return my free gift EarPods I will complain in consumer forrum bec I can’t keep quite now after knowing this, this is pattetic, horrible, once again I wil not keep quite.",iPhone 11
"Black shadow on the display as i unboxed , it went away in a few minutes but came back after one hour of usage . Called Amazon and arranged for a return rightaway.",iPhone 11
"I bought white in colour and its feel solid premium!! The camera are way more than expected..Now cons are charger and battery life but it can be fixed by fast charger..Apart from con, i feel like its a package of everything!! Reception are more than average..You don’t need 90 hz speed,, pubg places very smoothly!! Definitely improved my game..In short, I am happy with my New Iphone..Price was 48000/- and waiting for it didn’t go waste..Thanks to amazon for delivering it on same day..",iPhone 11
"Before placing the order on the prime day sale, I was very confused about the incredible offers they put up. My neighbour shop warned me about the refurbished phone. But negating all the confusion and risk, I ordered. And I got a perfectly normal brand new iPhone.I am writing this review just to let everyone out there, OFFERS ARE REAL. Grab them!!",iPhone 11
"The reason why I am writing this review is some people received fraud product. I brought this too at Amazon's great Indian sale and got the right one. Its authentic and I got it checked online by just providing my ime number to apple. Delivery was on time. I am not blaming other people for the fraud on them, they maybe right but right now I am satisfied with the product. Speaking about battery life you should buy a 18watt fast charger either through apple store online or through third party companies such as anker. Slightly less battery backup can be compromised by fast charging.",iPhone 11

   iphone 11 is the perfect iphone, best mixture of performance and battery life.A must buy if you are looking for a best in class camera, performance and battery.",iPhone 11
"this is the best premium midrange phone, forget the Chinese brands they dont even come close to the build quality & experience Apple have, dont buy phones by comparing spec sheets iPhones are super well optimized gives the best experience, iOS is butter smootg & feels great, camera is unbeatable, battery life is strong the only negetive is the low refresh rate so instagram scrolling experience is really bad but lcd displays are much softer to the eyes ao u’ll strain less",iPhone 11
"First of all there’s no fingerprint sensor in this, which could be an advantage for some and a disadvantage for some people too! One thing you need to note that during this pandemic (COVID-19) you can only use passcode as the only way to unlock your phone (of course while wearing a mask) now to the main topic this phone’s a great machine! This is my first iPhone and hell yeah I’m in love with it (also I cracked a great deal on this). If you wanna by your first iPhone you can consider this. But if you have iPhone X or above model right now and considering to buy This,then This phone’s Bazeels ( sorry don’t know the correct wordings or so) are gonna irritate you a lot! I’m gonna strongly recommend you this phone if your budget is about 50000.",iPhone 11
Nice classy metallic finishing. Camera quality were with 12 megapixel sensor is okay but not great.Phone battery is okay gives a days life. Face unlock is some times does nt happens we need to key in the passcode to unlock the phone.Migrating data is simple from android to IOS. But migrating what's app data should be done through purchased 3rd part software. Phone consumes lots of internet compared to android. A decent phone got in discount through amazon. Amazon delivery is awesome. Customer care took my order on priority and pushed the delivery in matter of 2 days from order. Thank you Amazon team,iPhone 11
"Ordered 2 iPhone 11s. Was really scared because of all the negative reviews but took a leap of faith. Thankfully both my iPhones were original and seem to be okay. Really happy. I ordered one from Appario Retail and other from Darshita. One red, another purple. Happy with both.",iPhone 11
"Good battery back up with best features of apple. Camera much better than the previous models. The face lock option proves better as in case you are wering gloves also, the phone can unlock.",iPhone 11
Mobile sound is cracking and earphone one side ear piece is not workingAnd Amazon is not providing replacement service instead it is asking to get it done with Apple store though i ordered yesterday only,iPhone 11
I am writing this review after using it for 7 daysI am a first time apple userBattery life - Decent for 1 day useCamera- excellent awesomeDisplay-though its 720p hd screen but the ratina display is awesomeIos 13.5 latest ios version feel super fluid and snappyFace recognition is top notchOnly con i found is the slow 5 watt charger that takes around 3.5 hours to fully chargeI am surpirised there are so many negative review from Amazon but trust me friend the material the quality the feel of iphone you get is super awesome ..100% Genuine product..and thank you Amazon for such a great product and fast delivery,iPhone 11
Everything is great as it’s supposed to be but for some reason this phone is heavier than my friend’s iPhone 11 bought in the US,iPhone 11
"Processor- till now only few applications I have downloaded and operated, but first time I have seen that now it’s very easy to download app in apple store & without charge(seems weird) ...in the times when fake phones are available & sold through same platform. Few applications struck during operation and I need to forcefully close it to come out of that app. It’s happening  from first day....feels weird after spending 60kCamera - it looks normal as compared what apple claims.Headphones- poor quality, I have used I phone headphone in past & their quality is much better than what I have received. Wire quality is pathetic. Even Rs.700 senisser quality is much better.Charger- similar to headphone they also seems pathetic, so thin & delicate that you will start doubting about their life.Charging time- it took almost 3.5-4 hours tafri complete charge & just 2 hour to completely drained out if you are using in continuous.Still I am looking for more clues so this phone feels me genuine & worth of my spending",iPhone 11
"Coming from an iPhone 7 Plus, this is a big upgrade. Don't disregard the phone because of its display. Personally, I'm not a Fan of OLED displays and their unnatural colours. But if you love OLED screens, this still isn't a deal breaker.Battery life is great. I am a heavy user and I'm able to squeeze more than 1 day of usage.Ordered during the Amazon Great Indian Festival sale for an excellent price. The phone came with that old packaging, including the charger and earphones but date of import, September 2020.Product was delivered within 13h of placing the order.The negative side is, Amazon doesn't mention the Apple Serial Number or the phone's IMEI Number on the invoice for some weird reason.But the phone's warranty did get registered only the day I turned it on an activated. So I don't think that is an issue.",iPhone 11
"Just opened up the brand new iPhone, after insertion is SIM card Got the call, whereupon got shocked to see that the screen is damaged from left side and there are grey/white spots as are visible on the screenshot taken by me. Customer care says we are helpless in exchanging the same since the Window of 7days has expired. It’s cheating, fraud and really unimaginable from the AMAZON.",iPhone 11
"I have been using iphone 11 for the last 1 month & these are my findings:1. Battery lasts barely a day, if u use the phone frequently. Using Google maps drains the phone completely within 4 hrs.2. Camera quality is exceptionally well during portrait shots & low light shots & front facing camera is also good.3. Face recognition is blazingly fast but don’t work in angles.4. Display size is good, & fonts/text are clear to read, color representation on screen is good despite not having oled screen5. Charger out of the box is pathetically slow. I always use my ipad charger to charge the iphone 11, and it usually charges from 20% to 90% with the ipad charger within an hour.6. You need to invest on a good quality back case/cover & tampered glass to protect the phone (personally i like the Ringke case)7. Phone heats up sometimes during heavy usage.",iPhone 11
"This is the most unusual experience I ever had with an Apple product. I ordered the iPhone 11 Black, 128 GB, the top portion of the Touchscreen was not working at all. Further, got it replaced with another iPhone in the replacement. The second phone that arrived was also defective. The speakers of the phone were super defective. It was highly evident that the product is defective. Had no option but to return the product and buy the phone at a higher cost with Vijay sales. Appario Brand retailers are supposed to be the best in the business. But two defective iPhones in two days is surely an issue. Really bad experience with iPhone Products. Had to gift the phone to my dad on his birthday. Made my dad sad. No Electronics products for me from Amazon now.",iPhone 11
At first glance product as expected but when it was received the packaging was worst. It was simply put in amazon plastic packet  without any bubble wrapper or thermocal despite of pre paid of Half a lakh rupees. Amazon India must see into proper packaging system.,iPhone 11
"I paid through Amazon hdfc credit card they mentioned bonus offer & instant discount, I contacted customer care they said it will be credited within 3 days, after 3 days I contacted again they said this product is not eligible for bonus offer.",iPhone 11
I like the phone. I love the camera. And iOS as a software is perfect. But the only issue I had with this phone was the weight and the screen. I would've preferred an oled display but seeing that this is a replacement for XR it wouldn't have been reasonable (That's apple for you).TL;DrGo for iphone XS if you want a good screen and that premium feeling and the perfect weight. Go for the 11 if you want the latest software and the camera upgrade.,iPhone 11
Super cool device.. delivered today early in the morning..,iPhone 11
Didn’t expect muchJust wanted to have an IPhoneMy oneplus7 is still a better phone than this but as I said it’s an IPhone,iPhone 11
I’m an iPhone user since 2016.So I’m familiar with the power they provide in the phone.I’m using this device for 5 days now.However iPhone 11 is also a beast.In my opinion BATTERY LIFE COULD BE A LITTLE BETTER.Battery: 4/5Speed  : 5/5(will handle every possible mobile tasks)Camera  : 4/5 (Falls a little behind in low light selfies)Display : 3.5/5 (i know it’s LCD but Apple did a great job.You wouldn’t notice it that much)I bought a 12 W charger separately.I wouldn’t recommend 18/20W charger as it’ll ruin your battery faster..12w is good enough.Dont use 5w it’ll take 3-3.5 hour to charge the phone.,iPhone 11
"First of all, I was so scared and confused to buy from Amazon after reading all negative reviews but still, I took a chance and I’m so glad that I made the right choice. I was upgraded from iPhone 7 and it was a great experience with all the latest specs and great battery performance. I have been using it for almost 2 months. There is nothing to question about quality or any kind of issue. I love this green colour as I wanted to go for some different color. Thanks to Amazon and Seller for providing the original product with great condition.",iPhone 11
LIKES +:Everything like a flagship:Battery is awesome:Responsive touch and charging is good even it is 5V: performance is mind blowingDislikes: so far i don’t have problems as a customer ; but i feel Amazon fba needs improvements in packing and handling as the box was having some dents such luckily didn’t damaged the box contents,iPhone 11
"Amazon has full-filled my wish, For an iPhone 11 beyond my expectations! I was a bit concerned until my order arrived .  But once it was within hand i felt relaxed . As the product is brand new and also there is nthg to worry abt the damage plus it also has 1 year apple warranty ! . In short i would rate amazon 5/5 for delivery on time and with all safety precautions.",iPhone 11
"Product is good as it’s an apple product, not much satisfaction with the seller as I ordered ones the money was deducted from account, in two hrs time I got a msg that need to revise payment as they have some issue , so I did so , twice the amount was deducted and the support system for cancellation of one order is really disappointing, I got both the phone & found really different to return one .",iPhone 11
"My first review ever in amazon. Dunno why ppl r so much furious about this seller in quota etc.package was more than perfect. Delivery was done with OTP to ensure it’s delivered to me. IMEI was shared to me right after dispatch and I checked the same in Apple website. It was genuine. Once I got the device and activated with Apple ID the device got registered which means I’m the first user of this IMEI device. Hence there’s no question of sending refurbished device.Battery is awesome. I upgraded from my old 6S.  Received this device at 56% by 11AM and after installing all the old apps, iCloud backup restore, one movie watch, 200 songs download from Apple Music, some 40 pics clicking - the battery reached 1% by night-8:30PM. Except iCloud restore and iOS upgrade restore other activities were through mobile data.Camera is awesome. Night mode is pretty great. The first pic here was with night mode and the second was with normal mode shot after two seconds. Both taken by 2:00AM.Overall it’s great to have this phone.",iPhone 11
"its amazing product.. very good looking red color.. 1st time iOS using .. it's small dificult to option. finally all good worth for money . go for it 128gb or 256gb...  4.7 out 5.pro; nice looking , good cam quality,display super,good finishing.right time received in only 2 days from order...earphones ..con; too late battery charging....2nd sim e sim mode.its dificult..only used single sim easy microsim method..in box not provide back  case cover and temprd glass.",iPhone 11
"User Interface is buttersmooth with absolutely no lag. Camera is just fantastic, you can expect an iPhone to do that but what blew my mind was low light images. Battery life stays charged for about 24hrs with slightly rugged use although I expected to be better. It seems like Apple has finally done what it wanted to do with the iPhone X. All in all, it sure is value for money, atleast for me.",iPhone 11
"For me, its best at this price point. Upgraded from iPhone 6. Adequately fast and smooth with all day long battery life.Only disappointment was made the packaging, seller has just pack it into a polythene bag instead use of cardboard box for safety purposes of device and box as well. Box found damaged but device fount okay.",iPhone 11
Good hardware at a decent price. The ios 14 is a good addition but no finger print scanner especially in such situations where masks are the new normal its stupid even with sophisticated ir systems for face unlock just dont sit right.Other software and hardware performance  are at par or better than many flagship androids but nothing out of the ordinary.As far as Software features and customizability goes Android is the clear winner.The Apple software seems quite restricted in a way.Overall a decent purchase.Shipping and packaging were excellent by Amazon as always. So no issues there.,iPhone 11

I have received my iPhone 11 128GB black colour. My first online order for mobile and I was very worried that whether I would get the genuine product or not or may be they will send me defective damaged phone. There were so many doubts on my mind. But Iam a happy customer and Iam loving this iPhone. Thank you amazon and seller.,iPhone 11
Battery life. Has been improved when. Compared to previous generationsCamera quality is good and pretty decent enoughFace recognition is bit fast and smoothOverall build quality good enoughIt’s been five months phone is working excellent no issuesTrust me you can close your eyes and invest  and I suggest to club with spigen case so that you don’t have to worry about accidental damage,iPhone 11
"+Excellent snappy phone if you don’t look pixels through microscope as it’s not an OLEd panel+ Good full day battery+ excellent water and splash resistance coming handy during now in COVID+ good main camera, low light is good as well, don’t use much of wise angle-slow charge-poor selfie camera- wide phone unfriendly gripping- slippery , use case- back glass smudge game- No hi res video support on YouTube- pricyIf an iOS sticker get this device if not get One plus 8pro with lesser amount",iPhone 11
"You will fall in love with this phone ...fast , Sturdy ,Stylish ,elegant all at onceCamera is awesomeBattery life is good too ,it stays for more than a dayOnly cons are following:Purple colour is good but should have been 1 or 2 shades darkerCharger included is slow 5w charger  and charges very slow 2.5 hours for full cahrge  , you will have to buy separate fast charger",iPhone 11
Birthday gift for wife,iPhone 11
"I was much happy with my iPhone 7 than this. The bluetooth keeps disconnecting by itself. Wrote to Apple support, got to know its a common problem faced by many. Apple did not care to respond. Battery life is still crappy. Thats why they are offering bluetooth airpods for free because the phone will always be connected to the charger. Doesnt last even a day of usage if its towards the higher side. Touch, camera, speakers, screen are all fine, but overall you expect better in this range. Yes the apple logo looks good too..",iPhone 11

"Review here just pertains to the product I've received from Amazon. Guys, some sellers are misleading customers with refurbished products. The one I received had certain issues with speaker and camera and Amazon was not agreeing to replace the same. But did ask me to return the product and get the return instead.Please be very careful while purchasing such costly products from Amazon. It is always advisable to buy it from istore because it is no 10-12k that you are investing.",iPhone 11

In terms of Battery, camera, performance, body, display- everything is superb. You will definetly get a different feel while using this phone and carrying with you.

Proper packing, sealed and safely delivered to me without any cons. Thank you Darshita Electronics.",iPhone 11
"The product is very good, color is also good no issue with the device till now as its only a day of usage, but this time i am not satisfied with the package as per amount paid for the premium product. I ordered 3 item but they sent it all together in a single box which is not acceptable. What would have happended if the product received turnsout a damaged one, i know there is a policy of replacing but it was a birthday gift, had to send back and had to wait for extra more days. Many a times i have received a serum with proper packaging with bubble wrap but the iphone came with a lame packaging. Overall happy with the product.",iPhone 11

"I've recently made a switch from the Android ecosystem to iOS. I'm totally in love with the smoothness of the UI the iPhone 11 provides. The studio light feature in the camera is supreme for portraits. Battery life is mediocre as I was using OnePlus phone before this one but the build quality is excellent. If you're even tad bit confused on whether or not it is a great buy, I'd say go for it. Definitely worth the price. Also, the delivery was smooth and hassle free.",iPhone 11
Thank you amazon for deleivering this phone before time within 24 hrs. I am completely satisfied with this phone  i was so scared after seeing so many negative comments but yeah this is truely genuine phone.,iPhone 11
One of the best ❤️I recommend you darshita electronics as the product is brand new check the warranty and everything from the offical apple site and used for 4 days no heating up or anything as I’m a pubg player too just one thing the charger is 5w and it charges slow would recommend you to buy a 12w rest everything is great,iPhone 11
I bought it for 50k in Amazon great indian sale & for this price this phone is absolute value for moneyPRO- HandyFace unlock is nexy level works like some science fiction stuffwhite color and aluminum finish looks dopeBattery life is also greatPhone Speakers are loud enoughCall quality & internet speed is amazing specially where network is weak or somethingCON-Display (it's just 720p LCD Display) but again quality is top notch,iPhone 11

I was using iphone 7 for 3.5 years and it was finally time to upgrade.Looking at price of iphone 12 . It was not possible to buy such an expensive phone.Thanks to great indian festival by amazon got this beauty at 45k.Very delighted by asthetics and performance.Although battery life is still an issue I get 1 n half day with regular usage. I doubt over the years it will degrade.Camera is superb. Screen is better than my previous phone so works for me.If you want iphone go for this.Otherwise s20plus is good alterantives,iPhone 11
"Before this I was confused in what android to buy, camera quality, ram etc etc and then I decided to get my first iPhone. and trust me just the best decision. Camera blows anything out of the water it's that good.

The phone is super awesome, Yet Discovering a lot of things about it, Installing Third-Party Apps, Using Siri and Shortcuts is Super Cool.

Camera quality is also great.In simple words this smartphone is good for content creation becoz of its camera but worst for content watching on social media. Mark my words. Poor display.",iPhone 11
"This is the best iPhone you’ll ever get(Bought in amazon sale) for this price. I was afraid to order from amazon but that’s wasn’t a prob after receiving. Think twice if you’re making switch from android, coz you’ll miss lot of things when it comes to ease to use and customisations. Man you’ll feel android is cheap(except oxygen and pure android), that fluidity, damn the haptic motor (sucks in most of androids). Here comes the big surprise for me, the “Battery” backup is great for an iPhone which i didn’t except. It gives you 1 and half to two days  of normal usage. It gets warm and bit hot when you play games and sucks the juice fast. Animations are smooth as hell and you don’t need to worry about OS upgrades for at least 4 years in which apple is shines keeping their old devices updated. Be ready burn your pockets coz slowly you’ll get into apple ecosystem which feels convenient and awesome. Will update after six months.",iPhone 11
I got the phone today .But having some scratch on rear camera panelI have attached photo and unboxing video,iPhone 11
"it was just an awesome purchase for me, because this is the handset which iam looking for ever since it was launched, the only thin that bothers me was its hefty pricing, but fortunately with this amazon's great indian festival off, i could able to buy it in my budget price, since iam an iphone user i dont have anything to say about its features and specs, the thing is, if anyone wants to upgrade their mobile and who uses it for a quiet bit longer years then they should definitely go for this device without any doubt.",iPhone 11
"Upgrade to 11 from 7 was smooth as the data transfer took place in just a few minutes. Features of iOS14 and the battery backup are simply superb. However, since the adapter supplied is of 2W, the charging time is higher. May be wireless charger or 5W charger should be bought separately",iPhone 11
We are fan ok apple 🍎 we love tge product,iPhone 11
"Got it for an amazing deal, Thank you Amazon.This is my first iPhone and it’s damn good. Had seen some reviews saying that the screen is not good, but let me tell you guys that this is the best LCD screen you’ll ever get in an phone. The phone is on the heavy side and needs time to get used to it. And Apple operating system is holding up good and their Face ID is damn fast.I need not comment on the camera quality as it is among the best mobile camera that is available at this price range. I will post some pics clicked by the camera for reference.Talking about the battery life, it is kinda decent will last you easily for a day with more than moderate usage.Would highly recommend this if you are planning to buy your first iPhone.",iPhone 11
"This one is a no brainer, I have been using Samsung flagship for almost 4 years and I'd just feel much smoother thanks to A13. Surprisingly this has been a very good experience considering I thought I would feel like a prisoner in Apple e. Whatever you can do in android you can do it here, it's just that there is a long and tiring process to do it. Definitely recommended you won't regret buying this.",iPhone 11
Very very addictive new iPhone,iPhone 11
Review after 1month of use . I must say a flawless device with IOS14 with A13 bionic chip. Its an incredible device with best battery Life and great performance . Buyed during Great Indian Sale . Thanks amazon for providing such an incredible deal within the price segmentPros :Flawless UIBest performance with Great Battery LifeNo lag between switching of appsGreat buy if u want to switch to IOS with best price nowCamera quality during day light is excellent.No ads like other chinese vendor.Cons :Camera quality during low light needs to be improved i.e in artificial lighting.Charging with 5w charger is very slow in todays era . It will almost take 3hrs to full charge from 0 to 100%,iPhone 11
"I switched to iphone from oneplus 8 pro , i have been an oneplus user since 3t, but 8 pro was so bad  and full of problems so i finally decided to switch to iphone and literally this is so much better than 8 pro , 8 pro was just marketing . Even the screen on this phone is better than the 8pro . This phone is a beast in every department . I purchased it only because of amazon sale at 48,000 i am really glad for the sale otherwise the price was too high",iPhone 11

"Not much has changed. Apple has similar products but then obviously the bigger screen, better front camera and better battery life make it feel like an upgrade. The phone speaker is amazing and LOUD, especially compared to 6S. Rear camera is almost similar to 6S. But overall, I really like the phone. The earphones that I got with the phone have an amazing sound quality. I miss the audio jack and touch ID though. Still feels pretty overpriced as compared to Android phones with great specifications. But then again, those phones dont have what ios can offer. A 12 mp ios camera is better than a 64 mp android camera. And better UI than android phones. So if you’re a photo junkie, go for it. They could have priced the phone lower though.",iPhone 11
"I always had an impression that iPhones are overrated and not worth the price. Was using OnePlus phones which where a bit low in price compared to iPhones and it is a great phone as well, but thought of giving it a go in this Prime Sale and ohh god, iPhones are surely amazing phones. The camera and sound quality is top notch.. Surely moving from Android to iOS gives you some trouble using initially but it happens while switching to any new phone. I love the phone, still find it a bit pricy but a great phone.",iPhone 11
"Perfect product received, I ordered this phone on 16th October and after seeing videos on YouTube people claiming that they are receiving fake iPhones, I was scared to death. As this is my first iPhone and I have recently shifted from android to iOS, but thank you amazon for delivering the best product possible. The only grievance I had was of the delivery because I received it in a time span of 13 days. Took too long to deliver.. but it was worth the wait!!!! I love my iPhone 😍😍 and the delivery guy was so good that he told me to unbox the phone infront of him so that if there is any defect he could sort it out then and there itself. I couldn’t be more happier!!!!",iPhone 11

   There is nothing extraordinary or something like that with the iphone compare to overall flagship android device i have been using, but the ecosystem & the iOS experience is kind of different & fluid and it's a good experience to have a Apple Device for first time. Worth for around 50k, glad i didn't go with the 85k iphone-12 not much a difference according to my usage. Battery is more than i expected, Camera quality is great when it comes to video recording, photos aren't that great.",iPhone 11
The 5W charger is really a pain....don’t know why Apple is providing it.It’s’ staking more than 3.5 hrs to charge the iPhone full and the adapter is getting extremely heated after 30 mins or so.YOU DEFINITELY NEED TO BUY AN 18W C CHARGER PLUS C CABLE if u want to get rid of this battery issue and be ready to shed an extra 5k.Rest I found an issue with the MEASURE app from the utilities section which makes the iPhone getting heated instantly within minutes of use.Anyone having the same issues ??suggestions are most welcome.,iPhone 11
Don’t buy Apple product from amazon they provide faulty phone and they didn’t take it back in the return policy.,iPhone 11

The phone is awesome and delivered the performance as expected.Bought it on Amazon great Indian festival but they not provided the Cashback offers as promised on the phone when I made the purchase.The Amazon changed the offer for iPhone after 2 days of sale and now they denying to provide the Cashback amount.Should have bought from somewhere else.,iPhone 11
"I am writing against all the negative reviews here. I have purchased iPhone 11 from Amazon sale on 23rd of Oct. If you see apple website only Amazon, Flipkart and Paytm mall are authorized to see apple products. I am purchasing smartphones since 2010 from Amazon and my experience is always awesome. It seems some conspiracy is going on against Amazon to tarnish it's goodwill in the market. If you see the recent incidents about fake apple products most of them are from Delhi, Noida,and UP. It's done my people working as a support staff. I  have exceptional experience specially with Amazon I will treat Amazon way better than Flipkart or any other online portal. They always deliver the product before time and you can trust them 200% as far as product quality and services are concerned. I won't write much about the product because it's apple it doesn't require any introduction. It's amazon + apple trust with quality so it's going to be one of the life time experience for everyone. If you have 50k budget for smartphone then blindly choose apple don't go with Android phones. It's quality that's what matter a lot.",iPhone 11
"Ordered on prime day of Amazon Great indian Festival, Oct 16th, 2020. Charger and earpods included in box. Delivered in 3 days, kudos to Amazon! Upgraded from a 4inch iPhone SE 1st gen, so phone felt big and overwhelming at first! but now adjusted. Pretty confusing color choices for guys, really bored of white and black colors, red is nailpolish color. Finally settled for purple, purchased a blue case to go with it (i feel best color to go with purple phone). Finally, the phone is awesome as expected :) . When compared to other OLED screens, LCD screen has slight less brightness, especially if u tilt the phone. But when not comparing, its really fine (do switch off true tone if u want to see full potential of screen colors, brightness. but i suggest keep it on for daily use). Finally, Assembled in India clearly written on the box! (including the charger). i understand some parts inside phone still comes from across the border, but more Indians buying iphones may push Apple to mfg more internal parts in India. very satisfied that less of my money went across the border :)",iPhone 11
"The delivery got delayed by a day but the product came with good packaging and I have verified the product on Apple website to ensure that the product is genuine.Jio and Airtel offer esim in India, so be mindful when you read that iPhone supports dual sim. It supports one esim and one nano sim.Great camera. Bulkier than other older iPhone models. Display and sound quality is amazing!",iPhone 11
Aaaahhhhhhhh 😌Super battery lifeSuper displayHandy phone. Must go for 128GB,iPhone 11
Online show ipods with this phone and delivered earphones...what is the reason behind this rubbish thing,iPhone 11
"It's poor quality, I was on call and suddenly the phone was switched off and till then it's not switched on yet. Poor customer services, no support from Amazon or seller.Pathetic quality how can a Amazon sell such product or allow such seller to abuse buyers. Need urgent solution but no assistance.",iPhone 11
"Well well well! The most hyped iPhone of the year isn’t quite there at least not for me.It has a best camera undoubtedly, but the other side of the coin is not that good. So I was an android user, 1 Plus more specifically. I was excited to switch to the iPhone as most of you maybe. Amazon was pretty good at the delivery and I got it within 3 days. During my first day usage I noticed a slight warm feeling on the right side of my phone from top to bottom on the back. It was prominent and I could feel the heat that was generated. I looked online and fixed some setting like location and notifications which would put a lot of pressure on your battery. So i thought it is fixed but it wasn’t.To be honest I never thought of iPhones getting warm within a few minutes of youtube playback or social networking on WhatsApp or Instagram. It was all that I had never thought of. My onePlus 6 was a beast in this matter and half the price of iPhone 11, nonetheless I used it for a few days and kept looking for solutions but all would say it is quite normal for an iPhone to get warm.To be on the safer side I thought of replacement but Amazon won’t allow you unless you have a job sheet from an authorised apple service centre, which was quite new for me. As earlier no matter the cost of the product a replacement window was always open. A disappointment then!So with a heavy heart I headed towards the iPhone Service Centre some 15 kms away from my place. While reaching there I put forward my issues and they were like sir it is quite normal for the iPhones unless you get a warning of over heating. They were not ready to make a job sheet instead suggested for a diagnostic test, which came out normal.It has been a week now, I can still feel that warmth on the right side of my phone and I suppose I have to get used to it.Talking about the other things the phone offers, Camera quality is the best, you get some awesome video and audio quality. A top notch I must say.You will have to cautiously use it for a longer battery life.The charging brick is good for a normal user, it is a bit slow in charging but it is not necessary to spend some ₹3000 plus fo a new charger and a cable.Face recognition is fast but I still miss my fingerprint in times of this Pandemic.So the bottom line is worst Amazon Experience, you better buy it from an authorised dealer or go to appleonlinestoreindia for some good deals.And yeah! winter is coming so I have got it covered thanks to iPhone 11:) Cheers!!!",iPhone 11
Fantastic buy,iPhone 11

   Pros:I’ve always loved the look of iPhone 11, the phone looks good and has a nice weight to it. The dual speaker audio is crazy! Display being a LCD is still pretty neat looking. Setting up e-sim is very easy. Primary camera is exceptional. Face ID is just as better as it can get. Bright light or pitch black it recognises your face without any issue.Cons:I didn’t believe it at first, but yes my phone does have heating issues especially while gaming, and not even heavy games, even the basic puzzle games makes it heat up, and restarts the phone randomly. The display is usually visible but can be a bit difficult in sunlight. WhatsApp msgs cannot be transferred from Android to iOS so I have to carry both, my OnePlus 8 pro for WhatsApp and iPhone for everything else. (I wanted to scrap my OP8pro because it’s Chinese) The ultra wide camera works well in well lit areas only. Even if it’s a little shady like below a tree, it has way too much noise. THE BIGGEST ISSUE IS THE 5watt CHARGER WHICH COMES WITH IT! It’ll take atleast 2.5 hours to charge your phone, so I always have to carry my charger everywhere and end up sitting near a plug just to charge it, it’s extremely frustrating. And lastly I miss fingerprint scanner, because I’m always wearing a mask and cannot face id.Overall it’s a great phone, and being able to use a few google tools on iPhones makes it better.",iPhone 11
"Ok if your reading the reviews i'm sure you know all the specifications the phone and your probably skeptical about buying online. So, i received my package in 5days in good condition. Also the product was original as i went to apple's website to confirm it.The camera capabilities of this phone is mindblowing. And if your upgrading from older iphones like iphone 8 and prior, you will be amazed by this phone. Though I wouldn't recommend anyone with iphone x models to buy this phone.",iPhone 11
Camera quality and face recognition is amazing. First timers will have to spend time on setting up the phone as it is not as easy as android. The phone is not too big to hold nor too small. It’s just perfect and the performance is quite good since it has only been 1 day after I have bought it. Overall a very good product and I love it.,iPhone 11
"So I bought iPhone 11 128GB variant. As expected of Amazon delivery was on time and product was in excellent condition.But when I put sim inside and tried calling, distorted noice came through speaker.Calling speaker is busted. Cannot hear clear voice unless you connect earpods and worst thing is there is no replacement policy for this. Only refund.Did not expect such service from Amazon.Delivering faulty pieces.Hope this didn't happen with other customers as well.",iPhone 11
"This was a dream come true for me. Apple iPhone 11 was on my wishlist for long. The phone was delivered to me neatly packed without any damage.  The phone was absolutely new piece. The phone is working perfectly and smoothly. The iPhone 11 offers excellent battery life for the form factor it is. I do not need to charge it frequently and it is lasting me the entire day with a single charge even though I use it moderately from making calls, to taking pics, to gaming and browsing web on Safari. Finally listening to music before calling it a day. At the end of the day the battery percentage remains near 14%- 20%. This wasn't the case with my previous Samsung Galaxy S6 & S7 which hardly lasted even half a day on full charge.The bundled charger is sufficient for my needs. Though the 5W charger is small and ancient it is ok as I charge it only once in a day. If you want fast charging you may have to buy the 20 W charger and cable separately from Apple. Also the bundled earpods are good, though I do not use them but my wireless headphones. Technically you cannot fault the iPhone for performance. Anything you throw at it, it performs more than your expectation. Calls, gaming, 4G, video, facetime, photos all performed excellently. I am happy with the purchase and would recommend it.",iPhone 11
"An awesome phone from Apple. Worth buying!Camera Quality is undoubtably the best in outdoor ! Indoor seems to be good, not great.Battery was awesome, I heard iPhone battery never last for the day. But this one is exceptional. At the same time, charging time is high. At least requires couple of hour to load and 100% battery.iOS simply awesome and flawless. Working smoothly!White iPhone is truly awesome and premium, loved it. Simply go for it.",iPhone 11
"iPhones are best in class and performance of any iPhone is just excellent. If you ignore the price tag (although I bought this iPhone 11, 128gb  during the shopping festival on Amazon), iPhones are the best mobile phones on this planet.

"Best deal on iPhone ever I guess..Pros :Best camera , even low light photography is goodButtery smooth performance ( people talking about 90 Hertz / 120 Hertz refresh rate on androids, it's far better than those), androids I don't think can match apple's ecosystem anyday..Battery performance is a big upgrade over previous models like xr , X's etc.. can get u a day  easily.No lags no glitchesConsBut heavyDisplay is not OLED like s20 plus etcGetting it for 46200₹ was the best online purchase I ever did..no regretsWorth every penny..

"Well I am first time iphone user and yes it's very annoying if u r android user for first few days and ofcourse u will not regret buying IOS.Over all building quality is top notch,camera is excellent. And battery backup is also good for regular usage and don't play games on it. Yes daily usage such as fb,insta,net surfing will not consume much battery I charge battery after 2 days when its gets completely discharge and annoying is charging takes around 3 hrs to full as it comes with 5V chargers.Rest everything is nice",iPhone 11
This is best phone of the year..Some people spared fake newsThe appario retails private limited.. company... They sold this phone.. phone is genuine and original...

No hang and bug like android phones (I am android user since ages). Overall best package as its iPhone and live up to the expectations. In comparison with new iPhone 12 in terms of cost iPhone 11 is great value for money. works just Amazing.",iPhone 11
No complaints yet awesome mobile loved night mode camera,iPhone 11
"This is my first iphone. After using android for so long didn't exoect to like ios so much. So yes ios is more refined compared to android. Iphone is costly yes but now a days highend android and iphone doesnt have much difference in terms of price. But when it comes to build quality, speaker sorround sound, camera quality, smoothness of ios, display even if in lcd i felt there is no comparison. Its just different league. I dont need customisation so i am liking ios better. But if u are more into customization thing then u may go for android. And final verdict.. Iphn 11 is a complete package and a real value for money. I really enjoy using it.",iPhone 11
experience is great for now.. however another feedback is that within 20 days I noticed a tiny crack like a hair on my iPhone 11.. Honestly it has not fallen yet although my previous iPhone 6s survived many drops with no cracks at all even after 4 years.. strange and surprising that the glass quality is very bad as compared to the old phones,iPhone 11
"iphone 11 is a very good phone to buy only if you can compromise for the display. The display on this is device is pretty good but you can get other options with better displays in this price segment.If you can survive with an HD+ LCD panel with thicker bezels and a notch up top then this is a very good phone for you.Cameras are awesome, battery backup excellent, great performance and a decent premium look. Good job Apple !",iPhone 11
"I am an android user before and this is my first ios device. Before i wondered why people are spending their huge money to buy it, but now i realised why, let me tell u..Camera:Better in bright light conditions.. but it is not upto the mark in low light or night conditions..Battery:Which is best and lasts whole day with above avg usageThe functionality and apps handling is flawless and i can say that no one gonna regret by choosing this phone..My mobile was iphone 11 64 GBAnd i would like to thank AMAZON for great delivery on time and at this situation as we get so many fake or clone iPhones which i was bothering about.. but AMAZON did a great job and got a brand new original iphone!Thank you and go for it....",iPhone 11

Mobile is not catching the network exactly after 2 weeks. Now the worst thing is it stopped accessing the WiFi also. Changed the Sim done everything but the result is same. After spending the money on the best brand the product delivered is faulty one. Never expected this from Amazon.,iPhone 11

"Readers,Earlier I was hesitant to buy an iPhone as 11 comes with LCD panel, I used to be a huge fan of OnePlus and was under the impression that 120 Hz would really make a difference but hands on heart- I’ve been using my iPhone for last 3 days and I am flabbergasted at how vivid the display of iPhone is that too LCD one!Now coming to delivery- Amazon never disappointsSeller- Appario Retail, received the original product and in good condition- No complaints. IDK why other users have issues with this retailerDeal- Thank You Amazon for bringing this product under Great Indian Festival otherwise I would have regretted for sureDon’t worry about 5G, is desh mein abhi 4G network bhi Puri tarah coverage nahin deta. 5G will take its own sweet time to hit the marketColour- Chose purple after speaking to at least 20 iPhone users and finally made the right decision- White and Black are too common for meThe only demerit of using an iPhone is that you can’t transfer old WhatsApp chat backup from your android device.Hope my review helps in decision making!",iPhone 11

"Its nothing new that iPhones are amazing. You can get the actual reviews on youtube easily. I would like to tell that as I switched from an Android to iOS, there is a very big change that I am experiencing. Camera quality, call clarity, every single aspect of the device is top notch. I got the 128 GB model and after installing all the necessary apps for social media, ecommerce and payments, I have around 20 GB occupied. So even the 64 GB model is great if you are not much into making videos.",iPhone 11
As expected From Apple everything feels primium. First time in my life I bought iPhone it feels sturdy and comfortable. Not too big not too short for my hands perfect feet as always Cameras are grade. I want to mention if any one wants to buy iphone for camera please do check-out Samsung S series also as Today in 📷 competition samsung S20 Ultra is best in camera than newly launched iphone 12 pro max. If you ar buying for video then go for iphone 12 series. And if you are a gamer and want to buy this phone then nice decision do for it just how many android gaming Phone came out no one can beat iphone in PUBG MOBILE gaming experience there absolutely no frame drop not a single till now. But In android there will be always this issue. I want to say if you want both performance and camera together to for it or only for gaming go for Xr. Iphone 11 not recommended Xr is less price and there is no such performance diff. Don't upgrade iphone until a big change not made my apple.like better refresh rate and ibuild PRO mode in camera more customisation options. Like that in INDIA didn't expect 5G till 2023 so that's why.Thank you 😊For reading my review.☮️ Out.✌️,iPhone 11

"After using it for around 10 months, now I’m giving my review. Really. Now, I can feel why iOS users don’t want to shift to an Android device. I don’t gonna explain unnecessary things. But one thing is sure that Android is nothing in front of iOS due to its open-source nature. Every brand is offering good display, good camera, flagship processor and more. But there is no match with real life performance with iPhone 11. You can still go for 11 instead of 12 or 12 mini as it will worth every penny for a long run. If you’re addicted to customizations or so many false myths then you should stick with Android. iPhone really teaches you a true meaning of a smartphone and what it should be. Hope you guys understand. Final words: it’s like an investment that will show its true value in the long term period.",iPhone 11
"This is my first iPhone and I have been blown away by the performance of this phone. The experience of ios is so rich as compared to android. And once you get used to it you realise how easy and intuitive it is. It’s been 5 days and i am enjoying every moment using this phone. Android might offer more features but when it comes to overall experience, you can’t beat the iPhone. I say go for this phone without any hesitation.",iPhone 11
"First of all the colour of the phone itself is so comforting that I love it. When it comes to performance it is Top Notch and everyone knows how iPhone works so no doubt there. No fingerprint scanner but Face ID can work almost everywhere so you’ll face no problem there.Screen response time is very accurate there’s no delay or lag and when it comes to battery life. You can pass a day or two very easily doing normal tasks but yeah the 5W charger in the box is very slow so if you’re not getting a charger from now it’s not bad.When it comes to camera the detail and all is very accurate, portrait mode does exceptionally well and the video recording is supported up to 4K 60fps. Obviously you can’t enjoy  it in 720p screen but it’s there.So overall the iPhone 11 delivers the best value for money now that it’s around 55k so definitely if you’re going to buy your first iPhone just like me you should definitely go for it.",iPhone 11
I am one plus user for past 3 years was kinda bored of android wanted to shift to iOS. This phone is totally worth it and has a very premium experience . Although s20 fe was available at the same range i purchased this phone.  If you are looking to buy it you should go for it without hesitation.,iPhone 11
"lots of bugs in this mobile .. networks goes while calling , internet not works most of time .. face id is not as good as it should be .. and as i said about network issues , it is only with this hand set .. as one of my friend purchased same phone and he is also facing same issues ..",iPhone 11
Bought it for my son for birthday gift. Perfect product. Checked genuineness from the menu and it was original with one year warranty activated with today’s date. Was little worried with few of the reviews about the seller. But very satisfied as bought on Apple days which gave a discount of 5400 /-,iPhone 11
Mobile weight is exceeding 194 grm as per standard weight  of device. Its observed 199 grm. Don’t know the reason behind this. Please check the weight of your device after unboxing. My other iphone 11 which is 128 gb variant has 194.5 gram weight.,iPhone 11
It’s one of the most loved phone in the world. Excellent build quality. Great collaboration of software and hardware. Ultra high speed. Excellent camera. Extra ordinary security of personal data due to strict apple policy.Price has been reduced drastically after launch of iPhone 12. What else you need in the phone?,iPhone 11
"I know that the 'Worlds best phone' do not need any reviews. But still, I wished I should share my thoughts and experience about it.This product was delivered within time and thanks to amazons for delivering it on time.I got it checked & verified  at the time of delivery.I bought Iphone 11 White color 64Gb variant during the Amazon Oct Festive offer,There were limited color option because most of them were sold out or unavailable due high demand this days, but I do not regret, instead I am more happy with this color. Believe me or not, Iphones in white coming from there initial models like 4s and till date are Apples top selling - they looks classy & feels rich. White color does stand out professional.I almost grabbed this deal 47999 offer + additional 1800 off on HDFC card which bring down the price to almost 46200.This phone is super smooth, thanks to A13 Bionic chip, it gives an immense multitask and user interface experience. The other thing that makes me feel great is its Battery Life. This is a huge improvement done in any iPhone models till date.Camera is another best thing of iphone 11, I repeat - The Best. No competition. You will have to trust me.Talking about the design and build quality, it is great either. The Aluminum Build and Glass back make this device stand out in crowd.Apple have improved the sound & audio quality in iphone 11. It has got the stereo speakers. The output is very balanced, loud and clear.Thanks to Amazon for there great service and deals they offer.",iPhone 11
I was an iPhone 7 user earlier. I switched to this 11 after my old phone broke. It is a superb experience while using it. Specially when you upgrade from old iPhone to this iPhone 11. The colour purple is awesome. I loved the look and camera quality is much better. Battery life is very well. Only thing is it takes around 2-3 hours to get fully charged. Otherwise best phone in market.,iPhone 11
"In ❤ With A13 Bionic, Latency, Smoothness, Camera, User Experience, Optimization, Build Quality, and much more.",iPhone 11
Don't buy don't buy don't buy don't buy don't buy.if your mobile demage or any issues they will not responsible to do anything.keep we are begging then to  chase then till the time our return policy will be expired. Go to apple store if you need IPhone especially.my 50k gone now,iPhone 11
Pros :Touch is really smoothBattery backup is automatically adjusted according to your sleep cycles .Alarm cycles are also tracked and the phone automatically sleeps as you sleep and battery does not drain even a single % while you are sleeping.IOS14 update came within 2 daysSwitching between apps is very smooth and feels classy. I switched from anroid to I phone and i love the way the phone works starting from switching between apps and smoothness of operations.Camera is really good. Slow motion videos and normal pictures have depth. Camera is at par with one plus 68mp camera.Various apps such as I tune U provide you free resource of Knowledge. You can do online courses for free on I tune U app.ConsBattery takes 3 hours to charge fully from 0-100% .Hotspot bug is there . It keeps disconnecting every 3 hours or so. You have to again switch it on.Charger provided is 5W charger and hence takes time . Although apple provides charging with 18W charger but I would recommend to use that only if its an emergency or else you will lose out on battery life.Overall a nice product to buy.,iPhone 11
"Delivery was a bit late, i absolutely love this mint green colour, bought on deal, loving my phone, absolutely recommend this iPhone 11,if you can afford. You can know more about the features and performance from the reviews on YouTube. 😊 This is a major update for me from oppo to iPhone. Loving it. ❤️",iPhone 11
"100% genuine.iPhone 11- White colour,128GB, 4GB Ram, Updated to iOS 14.I ordered it about a week ago(17th Oct) and Amazon made sure that I get the choice of color and storage I ordered. Took a few days to source the this for me. Received it on 23rd Oct. But I must be honest this is one of the best thing I could get on festival occasion and Diwali gift.I also ordered the 12 Watts charging adaptor for fast charging. The charging time reduces drastically to 1.5 hours to full 100% battery. Additionally, I updated the OS to iOS 14. Seems like the system optimized a bit to function faster post update.Sound quality is awesome, camera is top-notch, battery life seems good, Display is not OLED, but I am not much concerned.Checked the in package - Earpods, they work well. No sound breakage or disruption.Power adaptor - 5W - takes longer time to charge; but better use the 12W power adaptor if you purchase.Owning a iPhone is a dream for many. Thank you Amazon for making this dream happen.My iPhone was sourced from Darshita Aashiyana Private limited.",iPhone 11
"I got 128gb variant at 50,000/- discount price. It was a great deal for me.But I had display issues with my product delivered  from Amazon. Went to service centre, they are ready to give me a screen replacement .",iPhone 11
"I was also facing the heating issue with iPhone 11, bought in recent sale. After updating to ios14 the device was getting hot a lot and with no heavy use also. For me it got solved by factory resetting the iPhone 11 from settings. It’s reset all data and setting option . Since then it’s working fine for me no more heating issue. For those who bought it new and having heating issue, please try this hope it will work.👍",iPhone 11
"Please guys dont buy it from Amazon..Something is wrong with the seller.They are selling used product instead of new one.The camera quality was pathetic.And when I tried to create my apple id for the first time on this phone I got an error saying( maximum No. Of apple id created from this device) but then after 3 to 4 attempts I was able to create it.I called apple care i called amazon,but the kept procrastinating.Finally after a month when I showed it to apple customer service outlet,they accepted that the camera quality was not upto mark.Now they have taken my phone and have sent it to bangalore for repair..I am left with no iphone,all the stress and all this thing at a price of 54999/-Pathetic experience with Amazon",iPhone 11
"I liked everything and more feedback come while using, but for now it’s excellent!!",iPhone 11
Apple products are usually very handy to use. This is awesome phone with very good touch in operation and good picture. Bit disappointed with battery backup as it gets exhausts by end of day with limited application running in background. Many new features like in built scanner and full page screen capture is very useful and easy to send and share. Very good Face ID detection.,iPhone 11
"Early impression: I am simultaneously using galaxy s10e , OnePlus 7t and iPhone 11.Looks- not the best from the front with thick bezel. But the purple colour back looks awesome.Screen- not the best when compared to the 1080 super amoled I have been using. But far better than pen paper specification i.e. 720 lcd.Camera-very good. Better than my other two phones.Performance- my OnePlus 7t is as fast as iPhone 11. However iPhone seems to be more consistent with uniform animation across all the inbuilt and third party app.Battery- better than my other two phones. However,the charging time is really painful after using OnePlus 7t. It takes around 2.30hr to 3 hrs to fully charge with the charger provided in the box.Sound quality- just as you expect from the top flagship.FaceID- the fastest I have used so far in a smartphone.Storage- got around 54GB free space out of the box. After removing few inbuilt apps(watch,garage band etc. )which I am not going to use , I got around 57 GB of free space. It should be enough for a casual user like me.Final vedict- got it at 46250 during the Amazon sale. Feeling better satisfied as compared to my galaxy s10e which I bought it at 51000 a year ago. Keeping android vs iOS comparison aside ,my iphone 11 beat my galaxy s10e in every aspect apart from compact ness and screen.",iPhone 11
iPhone 11 has improved the battery life. For me it goes up one and half day to two days with single charge. Face recognition is really quick and accurate. The best part is if you are sleeping none will have access to your phone by placing your phone in front of your face. Your eyes should be open to unlock your phone. The camera is really awesome. There are few modes which is really great line monochrome mode studio light mode. It gives fabulous effects on your photos,iPhone 11
"Great phone from Apple. As usual premium feel. Performance is great. Face unlock, battery life, camera quality is superb. Amazon delivery is great",iPhone 11
Amazing!!!!!,iPhone 11
Never buy such costly products from amazon. They never return it back if the product is defective or even it’s not working. I brought this iPhone 11 and found there is a small foreign particle inside its display. Amazon asked me to get it checked in Apptronics and apptronics people are not even ready to touch the phone as it is not purchased from apple store. Now I’m using the same defective device. Got a good lesson- Never buy any product above 5000 from online shopping websites.,iPhone 11
"Got this delivered today after 17 days only because it was out of stock during sale. But it's all worth the wait. No doubt iPhone is iphone.Best Premium quality phone in this price range.Got it at 46250₹ during GAF sale for the 64Gb variant.This is my ever IOS experience and I know it'll take time to adjust with it. Everything seems paid in IOS but need to find a way 😅You'll notice the LCD screen only when you're comparing it with another OLED phone otherwise it's display is Okay!!The stereo speakers are fabulous, even the earpods sounds amazing.I would also like to tell the people who kept saying they got fooled by Amazon, they didn't got Airpods as it was mentioned...my dear it was already mentioned Earpods and not Airpods, there's the difference between Ear and Air. Apple calls the normal Earphones as Earpods and the bluetooth one's are called Airpods.Will update after a month of usage.",iPhone 11
I am more than delighted .. apple has its own charm although I have used some apple devices like iPad and Mac this is my first iPhone and ya getting into the ecosystem I am surprised to know why apple turn up everyone’s head .. thank you apple to make our life a bit easier through technology although u take heavy bucks for everything.. 😂😂 but anyway this is a review and except from price everything is just more than a charm,iPhone 11
My review after 7 months of use ... battery health at 96%... that is mostly because I use a fast charger now and then else the health would have been at ~98%... yes the phone heats up at load and when plugged even interaction with the phone is hard as the temp go crazy ... never was concerned about the storage as I use cloud ... it’s fine ... will update his post later a year ... I invested in the phone for the long 6+ years S/W support ...,iPhone 11
What about 5% money back offer...I've made payment by icici credit card Nd I'm a prime member too. However I haven't received the amount yet.Kindly acknowledge,iPhone 11
"It’s having potential defect with ringer. Phone isn’t ringing on incoming calls. Checked all settings, it’s a manufacturing defect or something done wrong at the seller’s end. Also, it had scratches on screen & back glass. Contacted Amazon, they refused to return/replace the device saying Apple products are taken care by Apple itself. We won’t do anything to help you.",iPhone 11
"Best!!!ultimate value for money,got it for 60k😊,camera(specially night mode),display,sound everything is great.Battery life is good,but disappointed with inbox charger,had to buy a 12w charger separately.Overall best iphone you can have in a lesser price👍👍👍",iPhone 11
"This is my first iPhone, and I was Android user from more than 10 year, now I tried iPhone and feeling awesomebelow are my finding.1.  Camera quality is awesome,2.  Screen size is awesome fit in palm3.  From Back side purple color is looks solid, along with apple logo.4.  Came along with charger and EarPods5.  Face detection is quite fast.6. Don't have finger Print reader but i dont feel much presence as face detection is awesome and very fast.7. Battery is quite good but charging is slow.8. it comes with Volte so that is good where we have network issue in India.",iPhone 11
Thanks Amazon for providing genuine apple Iphone i had check it online apple authorised in apple online site it’s genuinely items warranty starts when i was active this mobile everything product is very nice and Red colour is Amazing and iam first time purchase online apple iphone Thanks again Amazon for this and i will trust you blindly in future any time.,iPhone 11
"Have been using it for past week. Switched from an Android device.Got this in the Great Indian festival sale in October. It’s Camera is awesome. The battery life is amazing so far. Gives you approx 1.5 days battery backup with moderate usage. Haven’t tried gaming on this and might not do it! Not a fan of gaming. Wide variety of apps on the App Store!The only ‘cons’ of this device/ all Apple devices would be limited free cloud storage/ backup, and the WhatsApp data not able to transfer from an Android to iOS. All the chats got deleted.Also, You shouldn’t really be looking for a review about an iPhone. You’re considering it because you know it’s worth! :P",iPhone 11
"(Writing this review after using one month)1. Starting with built quality, I assure you will get the best premium feel.2. Camera is just awesome,rare and front both.3. If you are shifting from android you will face battery issue. The charge is not that great as compared to android. But with time you will learn to use it properly.4. The face id works butter smooth.5. The dolby audio is something I am great fan of. The sound quality is something heavenly.6. The display enough smooth. It gives tough competition to the 90fps devices.7. If you are thinking to buy it for gaming, I suggest you not to buy this.8. The phone gets heated up after 1 classic match only in Pubg.9. Leaving the gaming aspect, without any doubt you can go for this phone.10. The vibration of this phone is just awesome. It vibrates with sound variation",iPhone 11
Product delivery was good.First I was worried to buy from amazon but I got a genuine product.Thanks Amazon.About Phone:1. Battery is good but slow charging2. Camera is not as expected3. Overall experience is averageNot value for money,iPhone 11
First of all got it as a gift and luckily it was dilevered on my bday.. About the phone no defect no scratches the phone was brand new as expected it was worth buying with the offer price . Loving and adoring it the fc id works perfectly the battery life according to my usage is good and camera is too good.,iPhone 11
"Bought the iPhone few days. Actually after seeing the white colour I felt had to order different colour though, but it’s fine as long as ur using cover it doesn’t matter. Coming to looks it’s average as described earlier and battery back up is really good. Camera quality is just good no doubt in that. Very crisp, sharp and colours are defined well. Overs best iPhone for a medium budget in iPhones.",iPhone 11
"One word - wonderfulBattery life - Very Good. Will take you through the day and to the next if you are an average user. Heavy users can rely on the battery for one full day. The phone doesn’t really heat up except while using some heavy apps (once in a while). But not bad at all.The camera is great, as expected.Face recognition is awesome. My phone recognises me even in the dark. And thankfully the phone recognises me and only me. Quite smart 😃I have used the phone for over a month now.",iPhone 11
Simply super😍,iPhone 11
"I have used both Android and iOS devices in the past. In fact before purchasing iPhone 11 I had Samsung S10. Working as a Software Engineer I know how important the Data Security is and we all know when it comes to privacy, no brand can beat .Pros:1. Camera Performance is absolutely great! Check out some photos that I have clicked.2. Battery Performance is phenomenal. It easily last for a day with a single charge.3. With the power of Apple’s A13 Bionic chip the performance is exceptionally well.Cons:1. Disappointing factor is Display. Though iPhone 11 has a good liquid retina HD display, considering the price point I think Apple could have provided OLED Super Retina display.2. Bezels are thick and looks old fashionedApart from these I don’t feel there are any concerns.",iPhone 11
"The most flowed Apple product,Received Apple 11 (128GB)on Saturday 8th August .And review in 9th August ,Please spare a movement before buying The  Apple product.The touch and proximity sensors won't work .The wifi and touch have huge response delay ,The sellers have should have mentioned that product sold can't be replaced (other than contacting Apple support center )The worst experience of what could have ever experience for Appple products.Trust me don't ever buy Apple products from this platform ,The seller has no accountability and platform is not transparent on return details .Most un trust worth experience",iPhone 11
"An android user reviewIt is more convenient than android and more simpler. At 1st 2 ,3 days u may face problems.  But gradually u will adapt to it. It lacks many android features. But considering better camera,powefull processor, good battery life. This is a good smartphone.  Morever its apple.  It gives more security than android.  Iam very much happy to have it",iPhone 11
Hi. I have received my iphone 11 white 64 gb on 7th September 2020. The charger is not working properly. Its not charging my phone properly as its very slow. I want a new charger as soon as possible. I am using iphone since 2015 and this is not how a iphone charger charges the phone. I have used a different charger on my iPhone 11 and its charging properly. I request you to please send provide me a new charger.,iPhone 11
"First of all Big Thank You to Amazon for delivering the product on time and safely with good packaging. About the phone review, honestly I am the First time user for iOS from last 9 years am using Android and Microsoft (Nokia and MI) mobiles. The Iphone 11 is awesome in performance, battery life, and many more features. Camera I used but somewhere I feel blur while zooming, but it may be I don't know the settings I will test this and will update in future. Face recognition is excellent I will say in dark also it will recognise your face. The performance A13 chip is buttery, nice touch, color and build quality is premium. Phone is costly but at this Boycott situation I will suggest all Indians go to Iphone at this price range you will experience a new way but with premium quality and awesome performance phone.",iPhone 11
Am gonna divide into pros and consPros:Great cameraExcellent software experienceStereo speaker have depth in audioSmooth animationsBattery can last upto 1 day if you are a causal userLag free gamingIp 68ConsDisplay 😖 though you won't notice it but if you pixel peep you can certainly find difference.No fingerprint sensor. I feel fingerprint authentication is more convenient than face scanner.Huge notch feels outdated.Charging takes one eternity XD.VerdictIf you want a phone for long term usage then you can go for it but if your priority is better display and better charging speed better go with OnePlus or some other devices. Rest be assured 5g won't come soon in India. Still I think it's better than iPhone 12 considering price.,iPhone 11
Un-bleavable how the seller can sell such branded product used and damaged. Sharing the photo there is a dent on camera and it was not a new product. Brand must take some serious action against such practices also Amazon must verify such niche products delevery on some other authentic channel. It's really gave me a upset moment. Not switched on even the phone because don't wanted to have some other shock and surprise ahead.,iPhone 11
Battery life is not very good but normal use it works from 100 to 20 percent for 21 hours. If heavy user of mobile then 17 hours but u need to charge at least once every days. Camera quality can’t be beaten by any other device. It’s really best . Face recognition is best in mid night also.  I will give 98 out of 100 2 marks cut for battery issue. Which is not a big issue.,iPhone 11
"Some checks to validate that the iphone is brand new:- Once you setup your phone, navigate to Apple check coverage on website and validate that Warranty date is exactly one year from the date you setup your phone.- Check for Battery Health. For a new phone it should be 100%.There is also one more unofficial check related to serial number starting with a particular letter (M,N,F,P). Although Apple claims no such checks exists, many people on Apple forums say that the checks do exist unofficially. If serial number start with ""M"" its a new phone, if its either ""F or N"" its refurbished or used device.The mobile was delivered safely and after all the checks, it's all good for me.",iPhone 11
"I was a bit skeptical to order or not reading some negative feedback in the reviews section. Thankfully, i did not face any issues with the seller or the product.my phone was well packed and sealed and delivered within the stipulated time. warranty too was one year after activation of the phone .As for the phone, its just awesome, fast, great battery, great camera. If you are looking for an upgrade and want to purchase the iphone 11, go ahead.",iPhone 11
"Im writing this review after 1 month 4 days of usage. Im using this typically as a proffessional one. Regarding the battery life iphone 11 is doing exceptionally good. Camera quality is awesome. The speed of the phone is also commendable. The only thing you make sure that u receive genuine product. After buying the item i was afraid seeing so many cclaims that amazon and flipkart selling cloned iphones so i had crosschecked my phone using seriel number, imei, etc. So guys you can surely go for this item in this price range.",iPhone 11
Got this for unbelievable price of Rs. 51.2k for iPhone 11 128GB.... this product needs no reviews as it is the best iPhone available currently in non-pro series.. Battery life is just amazing... need to charge once in 2 days...Thanks Amazon for the huge discount...,iPhone 11
"i like product in every way the camera , battery backup, user interface everything good the best my last use was iphone 7 after i switch to iphone 11 the both diffrent in every way by user interfrace everything was planning to go for 12 but i think 11 is also not bad option because there both fuction are pretty same like the product money well spend :)",iPhone 11
love iphone 11... and its green colur is unique👌🤩🥰,iPhone 11
"When I decided to upgrade my iPhone from 7 to iPhone 11, I browsed through in Amazon, I was shocked when I saw the review, there were quite a few bad reviews and I was so skeptical whether I should buy it from Amazon... it took me a week to decided and finally I thought let me take a risk. I purchased the phone and it was delivered to me the very next day. I opened the box with lots of doubts, but all my doubts turned into smile when I switched on my phone, it works brilliantly and I didn’t have any trouble.. the phone is amazing and I just love it.. I made the right choice. Only disappointment I had was the box doesn’t come with an charger adapter. Otherwise the phone is just amazing.",iPhone 11
I got the product today but the earpod is missing. What can I do now?,iPhone 11
"After 2 day of use i found worth it Camera quality is very good before buying I’m bit worried by reading reviews about heating issue and hanging issue, at first time charge phone bit heated but manageable after that no heat issue as such I haven’t played game coz not a fan of games and all. Battery backup is also decent. Only drawback i see is that at this huge price only 5w slow charger is provided",iPhone 11
"Awesome camera features, just like professionals! So many features, that I strongly suggest to check out tips and tricks video on you tube... so that you don't miss out any of the hidden features! They say that, battery is improved. But I don't see, much change. May be because of my use. Otherwise ok. And about face recognition.... I suggest you record your face picture in all light conditions to your phone camera. Because, if you record your face in bright daylight, the phone finds it difficult to recognise you in low light conditions. Rest All fantastic! Even delivery was lightening fast and well secured! The packet was opened in front of me (after confirming my identity!) and I was asked to check the contents before delivery. You will enjoy carrying iPhone 11. Feel proud & Go for it!👍",iPhone 11
Good Phone.. buy android if u want better value 😁 Gave this to my sister who loves it. im still amazed how ios user can tolerate the User Interface and the file management!!,iPhone 11
I am an android user till date . But super excited for this hard earned money buy. Loved the in hand feel of the iPhone 11. I am very happy.. will update about the phone after a month of usage. Brought this super hero from great Indian festival .at 12 am midnight. And seller shipped it in the morning. Thanks.,iPhone 11
Every thing is excellent and do not afraid if it starts heating bcz it is normal for iphones or ipads bcz they transfer their heat to the surrounding via metal plate.And if you want to cool it you can put in in cold water.(IP68)I also.,iPhone 11
"I have iPhone 11 (Red)Battery: 4.5/5 ⭐️Amazing battery backup given that it’s only close to 3000mAh capacity. Battery optimisation is great.

"Great mobile for the price I bought during Prime sale for 46k(including cashback on hdfc card).Ordered at 12am midnight and received it on next day morning, so delivery was speed enough*Was quite worried about how genuine it'll be since Appario retail Pvt Ltd was the seller. But I have to agree, the product is very much genuine and you can check it easily by giving the serial number in apple website.Being the first time iOS user , I am quite enjoying the product and do not see any flaws till now.However mobile gets heated up a bit while charging (quite common).Greatly satisfied and happy for the purchase!😊",iPhone 11

"This is my first iPhone so I am learning to use it.Being a tech savvy person, I liked the software, battery backup, touch very much. Earlier Iused google and Samsung phones, but iPhone is definitely superior. It is more secure than android ones and the settings in each app is highly customisable.It is a nice purchase from Amazon.Thank you Amazon for timely and safe delivery!",iPhone 11
So I got my hands on this beautiful purple iPhone 11 and it feels amazing.I upgraded from iPhone 8 to 11 and tbh the 3 year old iPhone 8 is still in the best condition .This is what makes me go for iPhone again and again .I’ve had android in the past and the thing that keeps me loyal to iPhone is that it gives me ZERO LAG and the BEST PICTURE QUALITY.,iPhone 11
Wonderful product worth every money. After good study I bought this phone and met my expectations. No much difference between pro and pro max. If you really like stander quality of iPhone and real feel go for it.,iPhone 11
"Why are people saying they sell fake products, I received the genuine product . The purple lilac colour I love it. But only thing I was upset is I ordered in 16 October and I got it on 28 October.the battery life is sooooooo good,I didn’t expected this from a 3000mah battery. And about the heating issue,yeah when I was setting up the phone it was heating up a bit and ... now after one day of use there is no problem, it does heats hip a bit when I play heave game like PUBG and mobile legends for hours. But there is no problem. And the camera quality, gorl please don’t talk to me,it’s sooo good,the night mode , man, look at the photos I clicked, I don’t even need to edit it.I LOVE THE IPHONE.",iPhone 11
Booked product on 16th October with HDFC credit card but didn’t receive cashback of 1250 and the worst part is when I tried to claim cashback Amazon Executive told me that there was no such offer but luckily I had screenshot of offers campaign so I showed them then they said that cashback was not applicable on iPhones but luckily a acquaintance of mine had ordered iPhone on same day with HDFC credit card and he got cashback also. So have complaint again for the same. Hope I get cashback this time.Coming to iPhone 11The phone is working superb. Checked all the accessories.,iPhone 11
"I’ll be frank here.If you are considering the phone just for camera, go for Oneplus8 pro. It has a better camera.If you are looking for a overall satisfying experience, above average camera and Apple ecosystem, get this one.The price is on higher side and you can get almost similar experience with OP8Pro.Having said that, the phone is not bad.It has perfect size(OP8Pro is large), Performs good, Face ID is amazing, battery is good, fluid UI, no lags but the micro levels of tweaking you get in android are missing.Hope this helps.",iPhone 11
Execllent pruduct. Be it camera or the battery life everything is superb. Earlier i was little worried that i should get this from apple store or amazon but bought online and i have got 100 percent genuine product. You can find many reviews saying that amazon delievers clone mobile please do not judge based on those reviews people just put fake reviews to get componsations and when they do not get anything for free they do such cheap stuff. Only regreat is i should have wait for more 10 days because i got this for 60000 and in diwali sale it was onlyfor 48000 so this is the only thing otherwise this apple product is excellent.,iPhone 11

   Clicked some pictures and recorded a wide angle video (may not be good as amazon compressed it here), but nothing can beat iPhone camera.Bought 2 iPhone11 during this festival sale. Amazing price and what can i say about phone, its the best out here.⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ For everything, prices, delivery time (1 day delivery), packaging.",iPhone 11
"I purchased iPhone 11 with wireless AirPod 2nd generation... i got both of this in 59k. Below i have listed pros n consPros: Both iphone and Airpods are genuine. To get confirmation install apple support app and get connect with apple. Have a call and check everythingCons1. Packaging is pathetic, i cant believe that a giant organisation like amazon can sends a valuable product just in a simple plastic bag without taking any precautions. This is very serious matters, amazon shouldn’t repeat this.",iPhone 11
They mentioned to provide earpods instead they gave earphones. I don't expect such catfishing from a renowned company apple to do such things. Not really happy to be honest and felt I would have switched to some other brand for the camera ughhh,iPhone 11
"Just amazed buy the great Indian festival sale, got benefited by the offer, I waited for 24 hrs others I would have got 1k advantage. The black version of it feels premium, camera, battery and display are optimised in the updated version of iOS 14. Yet to explore more of its claims. Just loved it, Amazon is systematic in delivery design layout.  It's  camera performance just adds icing to the memories you want to capture.",iPhone 11
"Switched from Android one plus to ios with iphone 11. With 1 week of use it meets and sometimes exceeds the expectations in terms of user experience. Camera is great , ios14.1 is cool , battery is decent but early to say. Hopefully would stick to it for considerable amount of time.",iPhone 11
"Not so good it’s a hype about iPhone nothing is great about it,my realms 3 pro is equally good with new features and good camera",iPhone 11
"Same issue as a lot of others my phone switched off on its own and now unabke to force start or switch on.  Amazon as usual said we will Refund not replace, Appario it seems is always the one swlling auch defectove peices the whole day i waste running around to get it to start work . Lost my data with no backup,  sad to know such pathetic state of these damn expensive phones.",iPhone 11
"The delivery was fast it reached in 1 day. The phone as you know always the iPhone are best at camera,performance,sound and display.As it is a LCD panel I never noticed it is a cheaper panel,when using it feels it a OLED panel because apple has made it to such level it never feels inferior.If you are so much concerned about the display and notice a point-point of display then you should choose the OLED panel iPhones(e.g 12’s)The A13 Bionic is Beast.It doesn’t need to be described.The Camera,oh what should I tell it has the greatest camera quality on a smartphone.",iPhone 11
"I brought this phone for 58k on prime day sale using my HDFC card .+ve : best camera , sufficient battery , smooth , A13 bionic chip , display ( doesnt feel like 720p display ) , speaker .! , colour , features-ve : no fast charger provided in the box , no telephoto lens at this cost , android users find it difficult initially .Overall , this is a perfect Iphone , and thanks amazon for fast delivery ..",iPhone 11
"i don't have words to describe the the performance iphone...the bloodline of iphone has always proved itself to be the best in terms of hardware , perfomance , camera , operating system + system security , build quality.......i am happy to be appul user👍👍👍",iPhone 11
Button placements were wrong and best place for power button is top (like previous versions) only. Now they kept like Android phones and whenever I want to increase volumes it takes screen shot. The phone also looks average and most of the time I mistook my wife android phone as my phone. Not very happy with iPhone11,iPhone 11
This is true experience of iPhone. I’m an android user first time changed to IOS. It’s really awesome compared to android. IOS very smooth & very easy to use. iPhone 11 camera 12mp has equal to one plus 64mp quad camera. Battery life is great iPhone has great battery life.  Dolby sound experience is really superb. One main advantage of iPhone is no heating issue like android devices. Very smooth display. Comfortable to handle in one hand. iOS 14 upgrade is feel great experience. I suggest to iPhone to sale in India with same cost selling in other countries. Surely no one can replace you in market.,iPhone 11
very premium colour (white)i got this in 46800 in sale  which is better then iphone 12picture in picture feature not working it need updatesoverall phone is awesome,iPhone 11

"I have got a defective peace and when I call customer care they are all making fun with our emotions. Never buy anything from Amazon. Amazon is fake and they are not genuine. They will simply loot your money, sitback and watch the show.",iPhone 11
"At first I was very afraid of ordering an Iphone from Amazon as many have very bad reviews like “given used phone”,”defective item”,etc. Still took thr risk to order it from this seller. FORTUNATELY I WAS LUCKY TO GET A GOOD PIECE WITHOUT ANY PROBLEM.An important note which i always follow is that whenever u get a package from amazon delivery boy -DO CHECK AND OPEN IT INFRONT OF HIM”many a times i have seen tweets that even u have the video of unpackaging they refused to take the order if some things are not right.Now regarding my views on Iphone 11 in a single word -“AWESOME”....Liked the elegant design and top notch features .",iPhone 11
"You Have supplied defective product and now as per your policy there is no replacement, Now I need to talk to Apple customer care why ? if i used the phone for some time than it get faulty than i understand ,Very bad experience and last 24 hr trying to reach customer care but not able to get the any agent on call.. kindly replace this item immediately to further escalation...",iPhone 11
"Have been a Sony fan for more than a decade. Since Sony does not sell its phones in India, had to pick this one. This phone lacks the notification LED on the front. You need to turn the phone on to look for anything you have missed when you were away from the phone.  No fingerprint sensor.  No smart dial or i am yet to explore the option. The earpods which came with the phone is all plastic and not useful for long hours of music. May be they are made that way.",iPhone 11
"Everyone talks about the good points like camera, battery or looks. I would focus to the bad points I found. It depends on the buyer who will refer what before investing.1. This phone has no fingerprint scanner.2. The camera app must have some exclusive features.3. The phone migration feature was troublesome for me.",iPhone 11
Really a wonderful product from apple. I'm a new user for apple product and this is my 2nd product after 8 years and price also I got 68600rs after using HDFC credit card. Initially I was afraid to buy from this seller after read some comment's from the site later I think to cancel too but now I'm holding a good product and I'm finally happy with the product,iPhone 11
"I loved this iphone. I was so confused to buy from Amazon after reading all negative comments regarding heating issue, dont buy from so and so manufacturer and i took a chance. Well I made the right choice. I have been using it for 2 months and never experienced any kind of heating issue even after continuosly using them. To the ones who are gonna buy them, jusst dont hesitate, JUST BUY. ITS AMAZING.",iPhone 11
"Upgraded from iPhone 6s 32 GB. Great Cameras (Wide, Ultrawide, and portrait modes). Exceptional battery life (Works up to 7 to 8 hours on iOS 14). Seamless experience. The phone is slightly heavier compared to the 6s. A faster chip (A13 Bionic). Face ID is great. WiFi and LTE(4G) support also is great. Great display regardless of it not being an OLED (iPhone 11 is LCD display), but colors are great. This phone is highly recommended instead of the 12, due to the battery size (iPhone 11 has 3110 mAh, iPhone 12 only has only 2815 mAh).",iPhone 11
Product was delivered in just 1 day😍 and received which was made in India 🇮🇳 awesome phone💯,iPhone 11
Do not prefer to buy on Amazon.The phone is good but I received it with scratches and fingerprints all over the phone.,iPhone 11
"An amazing Phone. I switched from Android to iOS and it’s too good. This device is really fast with the A13 Bionic chip. The camera and the different modes as well as the Portrait feature is just outstanding. Don’t go for 12 if you are greeting 11 at such a great price. I got it at 44.9k which included and exchange of an older phone plus discounts on cc and Amazon cash back. Overall, the best phone in this range.",iPhone 11

Excellent product by Apple once again.Camera quality is fantastic and low-light pictures are brilliant.Battery Life is decent and last for full one day (as per usage).Face ID is really fast (can be annoying outside since you are wearing a mask these days)Screen is rich in color and vides and photos looks amazing.Overall an excellent device.,iPhone 11
The product was delivered before the said the date which was wonderful as i was super excited . I have ready many bad reviews for the product and was afraid of the same but got it without any defects and its working as expected . I got my 128 gb at a good price on the big billion day.There was no hassle in the exchange as i have opted for it by giving my old iphone 7 for this one and the executive was professional where my phone had a scratch on the body but they have taken it as the screen was clear and perfect.,iPhone 11
"Though the reviews were bad of seller.. was little bit afraid..But recieved a brand new iphone 11 at 46750₹.The color is so fresh,calm and composed.Looks very affluent onc u hold it in ur hand.Camera quality is just fab.If you hav good budgetDen plz go for dis phone.",iPhone 11

"The iPhone11 is a beast phone i mean the phone perfectly work in every field like the phone is very for Gaming,blogging,for pics and all its give u full security,privacy and protection so iPhone11 is alrounder.... And the most impressive things is the battery capacity of 11 is 3110mAh but it give u more battery life than 5000mAh android phones.... and last thing is Y I give 4star not 5 because iPhone11 comes with 5watt adaptor... comeon Apple we buy 68k phone and u give us 5watt adaptor... that it So my viewpoint is u can buy the best I mean iPhone11...",iPhone 11
"Switching from iPhone 6s, iPhone 11 was such a good option. As there were battery issues with iPhone 6s but there are none with this one, absolutely great battery life. Also, the camera quality is way too enhanced... it’s damn awesome ! Plus, not to forget about the face unlock that precisely detects your face even when there’s less light. Talking about delivery and packaging, I received the package in proper conditions from amazon & there were no damages on the outside or inside of the package i.e. I received my phone as expected ! Absolutely happpyyy with this purchase, Thanks Amazon.",iPhone 11

It has some heating issues and the wide angle lens is quiet grainy in-terms of picture quality.,iPhone 11
I had been using android for more than 7 year so thought of changing the phone so bought iPhone 11 Green it been a month now it super smooth and battery is very good last a day or more depends on a user. Only drawback is cant back up whatsapp from android 🙃 so people who are thinking to buy just go for it with hesitation. And the delivery was super fast got my phone delivered within 14hrs,iPhone 11
My brother and sister  don't buy the product form Amazon becz they give republics phone given... This I phone 11...he given me display spot in it....picture attacted plz see.....but he take. The replace and money transfer to me....my 4 days are visited...becz of the...,iPhone 11
Using since one month issue with display contacted customer service they told issue with display they will replace which is not that expected changed display Face ID not working if this issue would have been in any other country apple would have replaced phone but in india we have to get second class service highly disappointed with apple,iPhone 11
"Over a good phone but display is bad... my one plus 5t has a better display quality compared to this... battery is average , on medium or less usage will last for a day.... At times there are heating issues.... the price is high considering the average display and battery.... The positive point is that the OS is buttery smooth..... Camera is good but not great",iPhone 11
Battery is plus and minus both at the same time that’s why 4 star. I charge it on Friday night that lasts up to Sunday night. One major drawback is poor charging time. I normally plug charger once 6% battery is left to avoid charging discharging cycle of battery. The supplied 1amp charger takes 2.5 hours to reach 100%.,iPhone 11
"Don’t hesitate to buy it, I got a good deal of 48k. Feeling lucky... just go for it... thanks to Amazon for giving 2 days delivery.Initially I was worried by reading the reviews on apple products by amazon but I can say I am 100% satisfied and will buy my second apple product from Amazon only.",iPhone 11
"Its my first iphone. Overall experience is good.The only thing that hurts is that apple no longer provide adapter and headphones. I did not know that while placing order. In the box , we get iphone, charging cable and sim tray eject pin.After setting up phone, look for software update. I got it upgraded to latest version.The phone gets heated when on charging , otherwise it remains cool.",iPhone 11
"So I love it , colour is also awesome. And face recognition is too good, battery is good if will compare it from previous apple phone, but it take much time to charged up the phone.So you can go for it.",iPhone 11
"Bought the the phone only a couple of days ago and got a grey line on the display, checked on amazon for replacement suggests us to contact apple, after a two hour chat with Apple they stated that this seller is not an authorised apple seller. Neith Amazon or the seller takes responsibility. You rather pay the extra 3 thousand and buy it from Apple directly. As per Apple this was purchased in Japan.",iPhone 11
One of the best iPhone at this price.No problem. No heating or bezel issue for a Norma user.Display is very fine and crisp. Not like normal lcd screen. Far more greater quality then other phones which show more resolution in numbers.Sound quality is great.And Apple customer care assistance is what makes them unique.,iPhone 11
"Just recieved my purple colour iphone11, a good upgrade from iphone 6s to 11. So far the delivery was good and it was well packed with all items intact. Well while buying I did read a few negative comments luckily I didn't face any.If any one is worrying that the battery might heat up mine didn't.",iPhone 11
"Really got upset by purchasing I Phone 11, speaker is not working from day one. I requested to replace the set, but no response, battery backup also not coming for half day. Pls help me out.",iPhone 11
I was using the iphone 7 for the past 3 and half years and this 11 is totally worth the upgrade! Not at all slippery like the 7 though. The battery life is superb! Also received the earphones and the charger as part of the sale.,iPhone 11
"Apple has its own quality,but Amazon fulfilled our (middle class)dreams ....thank you Amazon @greatindianfestival...”amazon, har pal khusiyon ki”😊",iPhone 11
Phone is premium feels good in hand sound quality is good camera are okay you can record 4 k price is high go for one plus 8 t I use one plus 7t and there is a a little difference between both iphone 11 and OnePlus 7t 258 gb where as my iphone is 128 gb price difference 13 thousand,iPhone 11
It’s a value added phone for the money. If you are someone is gonna buy an iPhone for the first time. You can surely go for iPhone 11. It has the same camera (except for the telephoto lens) of the pro models. The iOS optimization would give you good battery life. Apple also promises updates for the next 5 years. I have been using this phone for 1 year now and the performance is exactly the same like how I bought the first day. Everything is so amazing about this phone that you won’t have to spend money to buy the pro models. Surely go for the iPhone 11 you won’t regret it.,iPhone 11
"iPhone 11, despite every critic or fan out there, will do one thing. It wouldn’t disappoint you. It keeps up the rock solid performance you’d expect out of an A13 Bionic. It’s camera is unlike any other. Battery life is good, not exceptional. Feels great in the hand. For those confused between product red and black, go for black like me because it’s not too flamboyant and more classy. 128 gb should be decent for most people. Anyone switching from Android to iPhone 11 will have a memorable experience.",iPhone 11
See the earpods..  It's a wired earphones.. Apple and Amazon both together misguiding consumers.. And moreover you will also not get refund from Amazon.. Think twice before purchasing on Amazon.. Better to visit store.. Get physically checked what you going to receive and then purchase.. High value online purchase are really not recommended..,iPhone 11
Very bad experience as a first time apple user. never expected from amazon being one of the most active customer. Delivered a defective phone. Very disappointing.,iPhone 11
"This is my first iOS device and being used to Oneplus devices expectations were pretty high with iPhone. iPhone literally has surpassed all my expectations and proven to be the best decision I’ve made. The battery life, camera quality, simplicity of UI and everything else is worth experiencing. I got this phone  of 128 gb during sale and paid 52,999 on no cost emi for 6 months.The price on Amazon was 6k less than the market price and the delivery was fast and phone was handled in right way.",iPhone 11
Don’t buy iphone from amazon. iphone11 to be precise. If some issues come up they will go in “pluaisble deniability” mode.,iPhone 11
"Awesome body and look. Weight is little heavy. No 5g support,No finger print sensor, no fast charger,no case inside box, best new was e sim support we can use as secondary sim I.e dual sim support in others words if we say, battery life is ok, over all 4 out of 5. Best experience I would have given 5 out of 5, if it supports 5g.",iPhone 11
"Good battery life (extreme usage will t take you through a 12 hours easily), however with the 5w inbox charger it takes about 3 to 3.5 hours to full charge. No fingerprint reader but extremely quick face ID. Good camera - the apple trademark. Moving from android is slightly tiresome if the move to iOS app isn’t working but contacts and other details can be pulled from google emails/drives.",iPhone 11
I am writing this review after using it for a month.Performance is excellent and the camera too.Little disappointed with slow charging as it comes only with 5 wt adapterBut now i am facing bottom speaker problem and its a very big problem for me as it stopped working and at this price point this should not have happened as from my point of view.,iPhone 11

"Awesome Camera & Improved Siri...Just enjoyDid not like charger provided with the product too less powerful to charge battery.. very slow charging capacity, however mobile last long once fully charged...sufficient for mobile extensive users except gamer.",iPhone 11
Product is good and original but i'm very much dissapointed with amazon service.Earlier it was clearly mentioned that if i made payment throgh HDFC credit card i get 1750 rs instant discount 1250 rs cashback with in 3 days of shipment and till date i didn't get any cashback. I have also called 3-4 times to amazon customer care and now they are saying this offer is not applicable in i phone.Very dissapointed 👎,iPhone 11
Everything in right amount,iPhone 11
Thankful that I got a brand new phone that wasn’t defective. I have heard stories and read reviews of people getting fake phones or defective phones etc. so far so good. This appario seller is a bit shady according to the negative reviews but take your chance,iPhone 11
Great product (which was indeed expected) as Apple always delivers the best.Switched from iPhone 6 and this has been the perfect switch.. Great battery life with such faster face recognition. And you won’t find a better camera in the market than this (specially the night mode)But thanks to Amazon for delivering the product without any issues. I’m saying this because I ordered the phone at 10pm and it was delivered the next day at 9:30am which was completely unexpected in these lockdown days.,iPhone 11
"Purchased this during amazon great Indian festival sale, costed me around 45500I was little sceptical about smartphone online but amazon is trustworthy so i placed my order.It was a steal deal for me!Loved it! It was delivered in 2 days",iPhone 11
One of the best iPhones. It has all the good features in a decent price. The good thing about Apple is that it gives you the same performance in iphone11 as the flagship iphone11 pro/promax. It just cuts down on certain features like display or an additional camera.Overall a good phone and a good experience till date.,iPhone 11
Mobile is superBut I will book on date 06/08/2020I will  Received mobile 19/08/2020My Account Amzon prime,iPhone 11
"Using my device for last 20 days and it’s been a great experience. I switched from Android to iOS and it seems to be a good decision now. Battery, Camera and Performance all are excellent. Display is not so great when compared Oled display in 11pro but still it is better than many Android phones available in market. Face recognition is superfast in any light condition. Only thing that irritates here is 5W slow charger but it keeps your battery health better anyways in hurry situations I’ve to use 12W charger(bought separately). At the end I’m super happy with my phone.",iPhone 11
"Its been a month i am using this phone i.e the iphone 11 which i ordered from amazon and got the delivery by 14th of july. Since then, i have never faced any issue regarding this piece. Except the charger issue it must have been a rapid charger instead of this 5 watt charger its still ok it takes 4-5 hours to charge completely.",iPhone 11
Its obvious how amazing this product is otherwise you wouldn't be here reading this review. I would like to shed some light on how amazing Amazon is. I got the product 24 hours in advance in perfect condition during heavy monsoon season. Amazon really surprised me and did an amazing job! No issues with the product. Kindly read all return and refund policies before ordering. Amazon is really transparent and all the information you need is in this page. So read intently and hopefully you won't have any further questions. Just add to cart and don't think too much!,iPhone 11
"This is my first iPhone, my experience is not good as  there is so much screen problem like the display not responding while talking on phone or doing something on phone.My request is to get it replace my handset as apple is also claiming to get it replace until the phone manufactured till May 2020, but my case is border line my phone manufacturing date is between 1st to 7th June 2020, would like to inform the distributor to put these cases to apple and get it replace as soon as possible as I’ve spent alot on this purchase.",iPhone 11

It's iphone its obvious it's quality product...But I am really very angry with delivery man's answer and behaviour...I have to go 15 km away from my city for collect the parcel,iPhone 11
"Move from android to iPhone but not impressed.1. Fingerprint reader not available2. Battery Just ok3. Camera Quality Good but Not the BestVery disappointing with weight, this iPhone is too heavy.",iPhone 11
"The phone is great. Seamless performance, amazing camera and good battery life considering that this is an iphone. The display is great even though it being a 720p lcd display it looks better than most oled displays. The only con is that the colour black is not exactly black its a weird shade of grey I’d recommend purchasing any other colour other than “BLACK”. Last but not the least Amazon was just brilliant at delivering the product, got the phone on the same day.",iPhone 11
"I had iPhone 7 and now shifted to iPhone 11. I love the camera, battery life and simply everything... it looks cool... everything is working fine haven’t registered for esim though... Amazing according to me not sure about android users but iPhone users will find it amazing.... still this pack has the normal charger but apple has released new one with type c... only drawback I found",iPhone 11
The iPhone 11 is all round premium smartphone for millenials. The photos are good in low light conditions. Well the little 5 watt charger takes long time to charge the battery. I would suggest you to go with the 12 watt USB adapter sold seperately.,iPhone 11
"Got a July 2020 make, assembled in China, 128gb black variant with accessories and phone box including outer seal intact. Overall happy with the purchase. I am giving a 4 star because of the packaging. The box piece was delivered within a loose amazon packet which could easily damage the product while in transit. Appario should really put an eye on shipping and handling as we are paying a fair amount for the phone.Other than that everything looks good.",iPhone 11
"Like the build quality of phone, camera and battery life and of course the OS.But what I can observe in last 15 days of use, the screen with lots of scratches. Didn’t expect this from Apple and the cost of phone. Apple mention it’s a strong glass but It can get easily scratched. Guys buy best quality screen protector with this phone.",iPhone 11
"There is some lag in the processing speed, the phone got hang sometime also,  there is a software update require may be because of that or something I don’t know,, but overall experience with my first iPhone is goodBut still system lag sometime",iPhone 11
The best thing I like about it is it’s camera and performance.Privacy is no doubt the best.But it’s battery capacity is a bit low and it got discharged in 6 hours only if used continuously.The smartphone also has a heating issue.Otherwise This iPhone 11 is a beast.I got it for 55k only so I will say that in this price the smartphone is best.If you are looking for a better premium smartphone then don’t think just go for it.The delivery was also very fast. I got it within 4 days.,iPhone 11
Got new phone today and noticed a black patch 8n the initial setup screen.it can be due to the wallpaper in the background....Awaiting apple support. And I noticed some else posted the same in the review. So is it a real issue or is this how it will appear?,iPhone 11
"Again after android usage I am back to iPhoneEarlier I was using iPhone 4, 5 and 6 Series for a change I was using android. Now I am back to iPhone (Specially iOS) due to the Performance.As I know Apple’s Performance - No one can do thisAmazon delivery as expected one day before delivered thanks",iPhone 11
Thank you Amazon. white I phone 11 however the camera quality and battery could be better. also a finger print scanner is missing.,iPhone 11
East or west Iphone is the best.I was scared beacuse of the negative reviews (appario) but i was wrong i got original product and I  verified though apple website.,iPhone 11

All good but it's a little heavy and thick as Compares to other models. Others are moving to thinner and slicker models dont know why apple going the opposite way. Performance battery and camera all working as expected,iPhone 11
Bought this for sister in Great Indian Festival offer at 49K. Its a great deal as iphone 11 is quite a power packed device even compared to iphone 12. Bionic 13 chip is fast for day long uses. Display is fantastic and camera is  quite useful. This pro grade product is definitely going to last for next five years.,iPhone 11
"I’m absolutely in love with this phone, this is my first ever iPhone and everything about it is amazing, the battery lasts me all day even with heavy usage. The camera quality is superb!If it fits in your budget and then go for it without even a second thought! Loveeee it ❤️",iPhone 11
It is my 2nd IPhone after iPhone 7.The best thing that I have liked is the camera.Battery life is not that much great .Face recognition is super fast.Overall it’s a must buy iPhone if you want to upgrade from any IPhone  predecessor.Apple could have given a better FHD display.,iPhone 11
Mind blowing and best iphone 11 in medium budget got it for 55k only 128 gb purple Thanks a ton to Amazon and seller and Apple I would highly recommend others to buy you will really enjoy,iPhone 11
"I don’t know why iphone 11 have heating issue while using camera..checked with apple service centre,but the problem is not resolved..feeling so sad..don’t buy iphone11.",iPhone 11
"I bought this phone in feb from Amazon, it worked good till Aug with no issues. After that randomly any app used to get uninstalled like whatsapp, insta, facebook. I called apple service centre multiple to get some help on this.but they could not help and finally i visited Apple service centre and they again formatted my phone and told me there was software issue and now this issue will not happen. Again after 5 days my apps got uninstalled. I regret buying this phone.",iPhone 11
"As you all know, how scared all the online buyers  were because of all the news around about the scam of iphones. So recieved it finally today. Took a bit long but just so relieved!!!! Its perfect. Nothing to worry about. I decided to write reviews about the purchases done recently once i recieve my phone and get all relieved. So here is this. Everything is in the box. All safe. All good. Thumbs up 👍👍",iPhone 11
"Absolutely wonderful. Works like butter, has been a user of mid range android from beginning so wanted to use. Got green one 128 gb for almost 51.5k and I'd say a good price for it would be bw 45k-50k. The battery performance for normal usage, the video camera, easy to use. Loved it.And mfs delivered it in 4 frickin days like wtf. But anyways if u are wanting to try apple its worth it buying an year old device lol.",iPhone 11
"Excellent phone....my upgrade from Samsung Galaxy S8 is worth it.Fabulous touch, fast and superb camera on top of it iOS 14 smoothness and features.However, it is a bit too heavy. Apple should reduce the size a little bit and weight too much.",iPhone 11
"Come on... Why are you even looking at the review..! 🤪Just purchase it..I purchased it because it’s APPLE (256 GB, iPhone 11 ).",iPhone 11
Only one word for this phone - it's a beast. Battery life is really good. I charge it once in 2 days with minimal usage (4-5 hours with personal hotspot on). Display is really good even if it is an LCD display. Go for it without having a doubt. My device is currently on IOS 13.6.1. I would recommend you to watch few YouTube videos about bad battery life on IOS 14 and then upgrade your device. Cheers,iPhone 11
Pros:Battery (lasts for a day with medium to high usage)Wireless chargingBest IPS LCDValue for money.Camera is brilliant. Low light photos turn out to be amazing.Cons:Could have provided OLED display.,iPhone 11
Better product but was very disappointing as Amazon great festival sale launched after the purchase of this device & while I looked the current price it’s 25% lesser than the price which I bought,iPhone 11
Less then in a month i have some serious problem while using dual sim facing problems sudden stoped  net while playing pubg and there big problem of battery  drain  display brightness problem  camera have no problem good at all bt these r serious problems i facing within month  so don’t go with iphone 11 plz,iPhone 11

Best battery life.I have upgraded from iPhone 6 to 11.Major performance difference no hang at all.Major difference in battery life too as it drains very slow the device will hold for maximum two days.No heating issuesCamera best,iPhone 11
"I shift from android to iOS first time. This product is my first iOS device. This is very amazing and superb device. I received made in India device. I order on amazon, Quick delivery service and genuine product provide by amazon thanks amazon.1. Camera Quality superb2. iOS 13.7 with excellent features3.

100% Original and received in completely sealed box. Am very much Impressed and happy. Amazon keeps me Amazing always.,iPhone 11
Phone is a must buy but the 128 gigs.Display is fab. Even though it’s a LCD. The only down side is that it’s not so bright as an AMOLED.Camera wise it has the best lens. Even the front facing cam provides a wide angle.Upgraded from an iPhone 8 definitely worth the upgrade.Don’t worry about gaming everything is playable in ultra settings.,iPhone 11
"No need to tell and rate the apple products, every one know about the products. I’m using apple product since 2010. World best hardware and software combination will be possible with apple products  only.",iPhone 11
"I am very happy that got the product originally,, lot of negative reviews and i was afraid before delivery. First day the delivery guy was unable to scan bar code so he left without delivery to me at my home and after 2 days different guy came and deliver it to me . Thank god i got genuine product after a bit of delivery hiccups. No heating at all on phone .. running very fast , great screen ,, thanks amazon",iPhone 11
Thank you amazon and appario pvt ltd for delivering my phone in time and with good packaging with no defects and don’t decide by seeing YouTube videos circulating these days you can buy safely through amazon with appario pvt limited,iPhone 11
Got the 128gb variant on the very first day of sale with effective price Rs. 49999/-.Awesome battery life.Very good camera but can't say excellent.Display is not bad but could have been better.Face id is super smoothButter smooth multitaskingA bit of network issues sometimesOverall it's a very good smartphone and totally value for money in this priceLoved the device.,iPhone 11
"I switched to iPhone from OnePlus. Not to say that OnePlus is not a good phone it is one of the best in the market right now. The first thing I noticed is the battery life, it is really really good! I get at least 5-6 hours on it with 20% left. Overall the phone is great and the apps work buttery smooth. I just wish that Apple made cheaper phones to tap the Indian market.",iPhone 11
"Android user previously, so if you wanna update to iOS just go for this one.Pros--Cameras are just the best-Display is LCD but you’ll not feel that it’s  that good-The haptics give a premium experience overallCons-Battery life could be slightly better",iPhone 11
"Bought it during the great Indian sell for 48k delivery was quick the box was a little discoloured otherwise everything was fine and sealed ..its my first time moving to iOS Face I’d is quick ,camera quality is top notch ,battery lasts for a whole day for heavy user also the only con is you must have a laptop if you are buying iOS devices cannot update the software  on mobile WiFi or mobile data otherwise everything is in top of the line haven’t face any issues yet",iPhone 11
"Got it on Amazon Oct Sale, including hdfc card discount 64GB model price was Rs 46249 which is good deal if you don’t require AirPods. Initially had trouble with phone not recognising Jio sim but it worked after few retries. 2 days usage review and all works well so far.",iPhone 11
"Worried, Scared, Panicked at last Amazed..... Reviews are good and Thanks for the seller Dharsitha Ashiyana Pvt Ltd Bangalore awesome seller from them for seller 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟For iPhone 11 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟",iPhone 11
"I upgraded from iPhone 6 to iPhone 11 and I am loving the new phone. It's very fast, has a great camera, and is extremely easy to use. The battery life is brilliant! The only thing that could have been better is the face recognition feature. Sometimes the phone doesn't recognize the face and you will need to unlock the phone through some other way. Otherwise, it is an amazing phone!",iPhone 11
Apple phone is awesome .. I'm a diehard fan of android and Samsung mobiles but this apple 11 changed my opinion about iPhone. This is a gift to my loved one.. now I'm also planning take iPhone once my android mobile dies... amazon delivered mobile well in time and the product is as specified.. I read many reviews that they got faulty iPhone. In my case luckily it's a genuine product and Amazon always delivered genuine products only to me.,iPhone 11
"Amazing device! Loved it! The only thing that bugs me is the Heating issue! I suppose it’s with all the iOS devices. Other than that the camera quality, the build quality, the display ( though it’s not LED but produces bright and vibrant colours) everything is gorgeous! My first iOS device and I’m in love with it!",iPhone 11
"Battery life drains faster, camera sometimes looks grainy. It has significant weight to it.Even though the screen is lcd, it is very good..no problem there.As a person coming from android background there are somethings I really,like for example the notifications are not arranged intuitively, if you download any docs or photo there is no indication that it is completed.Overall a good product to buy.",iPhone 11
iOS is easily the most intuitive piece of software you will ever use. I have used tons of different phones and software and this has hands down taken the least amount of time taken to learn.What's more is that you can use Siri to control the phone and every single app without ever having to touch the phone. The camera has also been improved to take crisper shots. The best part is the automatic night mode which is different from the other phones where you will have to tweak the settings yourself.,iPhone 11
Everythin about phn is so good.Only thing that i did not like is the adapter given for charging..It is of 5W only and it take almost 2.5 to 3 hra to charge your phn to 100%.When. You are spending so much amount then we should expect from apple to provide with compatible charger as they are giving in pro and max pro..,iPhone 11
"It's camera is protruded which may get scratches once placed on some object. Also, phone is bit slippery.",iPhone 11
"The phone is amazing. Every iPhone comes with a better camera and no other phone can ever match the same. However, the battery life sucks. I don't know when would apple work on its battery.",iPhone 11
"Bought iphone 11 on 20/10/2020. It is a genuine product. Original. The phone is excellent. Loving it.Camera, FaceID, battery everything works well until now. This phone has typically exceeded my expectations. Also this phone, after the price drop is worth the buy.Appario is the dealer that delivered. They look genuine. So thanks :)Go for it. Here's my 5 stars.",iPhone 11
My charger stopped working in 10 days. I think they are not selling authentic accessories. It's a lesson learned that never ever buy such gadgets from amazon. Buy your iphone only from apple store. Highly unsatisfied after paying heavily.,iPhone 11
Iphone is the best phone. The camera quality is superb . User interface is good. Phone doesnot slow anytime. Only battery backup is less but is manageable.,iPhone 11
I am writing this review after using it for one day. It cost me around 53k in Sell. I am happy with my purchase camera quality is very good specially in low light and the performance is awesome. I am giving 4 star bcz my box is little damage around corner but still the phone is in good condn.,iPhone 11
"Iphone 11 is one of the best in the market right now and i got it in sale, so it’s a bang for the buck.I received the product prior to the estimated delivery date and good service from amazon.A simple and subtle device yet a remarkable one.Well the notch and the face ID takes time to get used to but you won’t notice it much after a month or more.Battery life is goodCamera is one of the bestAnd the IOS is good as always.",iPhone 11
My battery health goes down 1% in just one and half month what should I do??,iPhone 11
Amazing phone with nice feature set.Look and feel of it is great. And at 50k price it is worth the go.Amazon deal is better than apple online store as it provides phone with charger and earbuds.,iPhone 11
Mobile battery getting drain so fast and it's also getting heat,iPhone 11
"Looks like quality issue. I see phone is getting heated once you use it for few mins.  Never ever buy iPhone from Amazon. Incase you want to replace or return the product with-in the return or replace window, Amazon will say talk to Apple and when you Will talk to Apple, Apple says talk to Amazon.  None of the store will replace and return the product. This  is pathetic experience. I will raise online complain including Twitter copying Top CIO’S.",iPhone 11
"The phone is awesome. The face recognition system is super fast, camera quality is also amazing. I am just disappointed a bit with charging speed . Otherwise the phone is amazing.",iPhone 11
"Camera Quality is absolutely amazing.Battery is good compared to previous iPhone models . But if you play high end games like PUBG (continues), you will only get 5-6 hours of battery backup.Face ID is amazing. A lot of tech youtubers say that display is not good , but believe me you won’t notice any problem with the display.Night photography is really amazing feature, probably my favourite.Overall, I will give a 4.8 out of 5.",iPhone 11
"Switched from Android to iOS. Pretty hard for couple of days to use it. Its not so simple as android.

Bad thing is its  5 watt chargerIt take 3 hours to full charge.. Buy in 46749₹ only ❤️❤️My second iphone,iPhone 11
"Battery life is BAD. In around 40 days “Battery Health” fell to 99% and on 46th day to 98%. Also, getting acknowledgment from Apple’s Support Team of ‘there’s an issue with battery’ is a task as for them battery is behaving normally.Good product and one should explore seller option just to explore better quality.I’m honestly thinking of switching back to Android OS considering limitations with Apple’s quality of product.",iPhone 11
"My reviews are based on switching from Android to Apple:Cons:1. Switching is too difficult, it took hell lot of time to fully recover data (Move to IOS app was used)2. Not All data got copied3.Apple Customer Service was not great4. Samsung S10 is sleek, having 3 cameras, bigger battery.5. This is heavier & thicker than Samsung S106. No fast charging",iPhone 11
I don’t need to review the phone. Nowadays we all do our research whole buying an iPhone or other expensive phones. This review is just to let tou know that I received the phone and not a stone or a soap. Just ensure that the box is properly sealed meaning there’s is a plastic wrap over the box and a sticker at the edge of the box opening.,iPhone 11
i had applied for replacement of the same but no response for the same even though it was abt to be replaced on july 21. Now repacement window is also closed. No contact details also to complain,iPhone 11

Hangs constantly,iPhone 11
First time experiencing exchange offer.  It worked very well than expected. The instructions sent by Amazon was great helpful. Product also is very good and it is my first iPhone!!,iPhone 11
Back to basics I moved from android to iPhone after 5 years and no regrets. Absolutely awesome piece of tech from hardware to software all the small details are kept in mind and handled well. Only thing I miss is fast charger that’s it,iPhone 11
"Software update ended up with an apple logo frozen screen, apple support was also unable to fix this inspite of multiple attempts and was suggested to get a new product as replacement however amazon doesn’t seem to have this model in stock till December and that’s disappointing as I have also exchanged my old 6s 128 GB phone for this product. It would have been a lot better if the new product is made available soon.",iPhone 11
"From a very long time, I had been planning to buy an iPhone and the Great Indian Festival sale made it happen! I could buy the iphone 11 at ₹52,999! at mid night when the sale kick started for prime members!! Thank you Amazon for the amazing price. iPhone 11 was a great buy with all the accessories in the box unlike 12😋",iPhone 11
Needless to say. Very happy with the phone. Using it for a week now. In love with it. Highly recommend.,iPhone 11
"I ordered white colour with 128 gb. I m simply loving it. It's powerful and helps in multitasking. Yeah it gets heat a bit but if you use it properly, it does wonderful job. The colour is beautiful, it functions great, overall, it's a great deal in 52,999",iPhone 11
Phone is quite good. Changed to iphone from oneplus 7. This phone is really nice but I find androids are way more easy to handle and operate. Cameras are best on this device. Audio is good and screen quality is really decent.,iPhone 11
Everything in this product is fine from packaging to device performance.The thing that annoys me is that when the delivery guy delivered me he asked me to open the package and take this device along with me and the packaging he took with him and do not handled mee🤔,iPhone 11

"Loved everything about this phone. For someone who is really up for a big upgrade and want a seamlessly smooth experience, you can go for it. It's totally worth it. Battery capacity is quite good.

100% packed and genuine confirmed from apple.Camera is awesome.There is no fingerprint scanner.Screen is okaish compared to Samsung galaxy phones.Build is good.Loud speaker is very good,iPhone 11
My first iphone. Was apprehensive of getting a cloned phone which is happening around nowdays. But fortunately there r mechanisms in place by amazon dat u can detect such things if u r careful. Nice phone n at an amazing discount.,iPhone 11
I have been reading a lot of negative reviews about seller but I have not faced any issues in my iPhone delivery or the question on the authenticity of the iPhone.Really love the amazing white beauty. No heating issues so far I have noticed.,iPhone 11
"There's no fingerprint reader, but the face unlock is awesome, camera is exceptional and talking about the Battery Life, its not that good but also not that bad to complain, if you have fast charger you have sorted life alredy.",iPhone 11

So basically you bought a phone and then you are on your own there is no support from amazon end.really not satisfied. Now i dont know what to do and where to go.,iPhone 11
Go for iphone 12.Check the price Happy with phone but disappointed with Amazon.Also amazon didn't paid the applicable cashback for this product when I bought it during the Amazon festival using hdfc card. Bonus cashback didn't receive. Also check for pricing increase the next day the price was high.,iPhone 11
Amazon is useless .gave me a unsealed iPhone which doesnt work . Strictly not recommending Amazon,iPhone 11
Over all happy with the product but the phone sometimes get heated to 40 degrees thats the only issue this model of apple phone have,iPhone 11
"I’m not able to switch on the personal hotspot , it show approach carrier , I approached to network carrier they said everything is fine from their side . I need immediate response in this",iPhone 11
Been using the 11 for a Month now. Love the phone so for except for the display. And few hiccups in software being coming from Android.It’s good deal for me to get 128GB for 53k.,iPhone 11
"As always iphone is the best, but you have to keep in mind that it's worth 60k , I wouldn't recommend spending any further! Oh And if you want Indian units then you will have to go for either black or white varient! Because I got the green one & it's assembled in Chaina!",iPhone 11
"Phone is just Awesome go for it ...I am writing review after 1month of usage,no issues as of now, no heating problem .as I have seen many negative reviews in amazon but I didn’t notice any serious problem.camera is excellent and it has a decent battery life.it’s the best iPhone considering features and budget point of view..",iPhone 11
Must buy worth for money.I didn't accept the iphone 11 price as low as 45k.But I bought finally.... Don't worry guys AMAZONE snd us varied products.,iPhone 11
Purchased during the deal in October.. Amazon delivery was prompt and secured.. Transferring data from my 6S Plus was very smooth and phone set up was hassle free.. Photos are really nice and specially the photos taken during night (compared to previous phones).. Overall a great purchase..,iPhone 11
If you are a media consumer like watching a lot of movie and exploring social media content ignore Iphone. But you want a high performance device which has a long durability you can prefer this.I don't see big flagship feature except camera and processing ability.I prefer to go with 1+ 8pro if i get a second chance or You already have a good phone then go for Ipad Pro Air 2020 with the same price,iPhone 11
"Its an amazing experience in using the phone!!!  pics, siri shortcuts......unlocking feature is flawless even during pitch dark... i'm enjoying the phone and its featuresNo fingerprinter but its enabled face unlock works great!!!",iPhone 11
Excellent performance and feels the best in hand.Everything you throw at it will run on it with butter smoothness. Although there is slight heating issues while video calling on mobile data and also on gaming with graphics at very high.The main camera and selfy camera is great. Wide angle could be better. But the videos are great from all these cameras.,iPhone 11
i think it is refurbished. Heating issue in normal use,iPhone 11
iPhone 11 comes with an elegant look and with a great performance. Its Face recognition technology works perfectly and battery performance  is amazing. Amazon has delivered this in one day!!! Thanks to Amazon. Loved this phone very much.,iPhone 11
"Fingerprint, battery life & camera quality is awesome but apple given only 5gb space in iCloud that one is not enough in terms of iPhone.Because my iPhone is full and not taking any backup automatically, So that one is more concern part for this any I phone.",iPhone 11
The battery life is just awesomeDoesn’t have heating issues on overusing.  What I really suggest is to update as soon as you are done with configuring phone.Charger takes way too long to charge but 100% battery can go upto 12hrs of extensive use.,iPhone 11
I loved Apple for years and finally experiencing the joy of handling it !! Wow very nice experience from out of Box (Android). Outstanding product always !!Found lack of awareness with delivery person in exchange process and it took time to touch my iphone...Other than no issues found in delivery of product in fact I have received it before the timeline. Thank you !!Everything is Amazing with Amazon.,iPhone 11

Super performance,iPhone 11
I am a hard core android device user...But this is unmatchable device. I am expecting more and more from Apple. Truly a joy using everyday.

Awesome packaging and looks good.. best part is it is manufactured in India.. Face id and Battery life looks good.. must buy!,iPhone 11

As I bought it on EMI I had to ask for replacement other wise I would have canceled it.,iPhone 11

I am writing this review after use of 1month of iPhone11 and it’s really amazing to use. Canara quality is really good and face detection is too quick. With 64GB version you have to take backup regularly to get the space management but with 128GB version it’s could be easier but this is not an issue.,iPhone 11

It takes 4hours to charge and 5-6hours running time. Present time nobody can wait 4hours just to charge a phone on airplane mode otherwise bot phone and charger can overheat.

“Battery life” is awesome. 1 and half day after rough use.“Camera quality” is unbelievable. Best camera phone in this range.A13 bionic cheap is a monster.After all this is apple. I think it will give a hard competition with a 1 lacs rupee phone.Display quality is negotiable.,iPhone 11

"You Have to Love APPLE because they not only make amazing product they make Magic ....... I loved specially the Ultrawide Angle camera and the Hell of a Beast of a Processor .... A13Bionic , I am an Engineer and the way Apple Presented the Chip on the stage blew my mind ...... that small piece of hardware has 8.5 Billion transistor and based on 7NM architecture ...... simple word its like a Lamborgini and other Chips are Honda ! Finally this is gonna be the beast of a phone and another thing that made me happy Apple might manufacture and assemble these phones in India itself! Kudos Apple You did an Amazing work! Your the Best!",iPhone 11 Pro

I have always been using iPhone since last 12 years. However this phone hardware crashed on 7th dec. my return period closed on 6th dec. :(,iPhone 11 Pro
just a lot of cams and hype. My children are buying it for status. Simply overpriced and standalone if you use windows. Just raising the price of such phones in the market.,iPhone 11 Pro
"The iPhone 11 Pro is Apple's most powerful phone. The most advanced iPhone that's easy to use with one hand. It has a triple-lens camera to capture best-in-class photos and video from a variety of perspectives, a new night mode to enhance low-light photography and extra battery life prowess.It has third camera for optical zoom, giving you more range.Even if the design hasn't changed, this is the camera and battery upgrade iPhone users have been after, the best low-light camera that resolves biggest complaint from iPhone user over the years.From the new Night mode and better Smart HDR to the extended dynamic range in video, the iPhone 11 Pro is now arguably the best camera phone around.The upgraded camera also allows you to shoot video at 4K resolution at multiple focal levels simultaneously.It has equipped with A13 Bionic processor, which makes the iPhone 11 Pro is the fastest phone.",iPhone 11 Pro
24 crate gold = Iphone . Purity & simplicity.Used Android phone from 5 years  buyed 11 pro and i surprise with the performance . I am now iphone lover. If i see any Android phone i hate it specifically Samsung s series and note series.,iPhone 11 Pro
"This is no doubt a great phone. Being my First IPhone, I’m just amazed by this device. It takes great photos, the most important thing for me in a smartphone. 2nd important thing is the display ohh i love it, this is the reason I didn’t go for 11. And the 3rd most important thing is the battery, this device has a great battery life. Performance wise apple is on the top of the industry right now. Their 7nm a13 chip is way ahed of its competition. In the end everything in this device from hardware to software so well crafted. My only complaint is that this beautiful device costs so much in india.",iPhone 11 Pro
I was using iphone X  for 2 years and finally decided to upgrade to iphone 11 pro and here are few changes i found while using iphone 11 pro1. BEST CAMERA ESPECIALLY ULTRA WIDE CAMERA2. BETTER BATTERY BACK UP3. STRONG BACK GLASS4.

On the few trips, I have used this phone as a DSLR, Photo quality is amazing and the portrait results are outstanding, I can compare it with the DSLR camera.Advantages:The portrait camera is amazingProfessional videography like cinematic shotsBattery LifePerformanceSounds QualityDisadvantagesThe front face camera is poorLow light photography is not up to the markCostlyYou can't set 3rd party camera to video call for apps like (WhatsApp, Instagram, Zoom, Hangouts)Rest use and decideOnly buy if you love photography and videography :)",iPhone 11 Pro
"Though iPhone 11 Pro from apple  is a good mobile,but the sellers are cheaters here,the fast charger isn’t working after 12 days of delivery ,camera clarity is totally low when compared to other 11 pro , gets heated up quickly...I Am going to give it to an authorised lab for certification.Will sue them if anything my phone turns out with duplicate parts",iPhone 11 Pro
This is my first iPhone. I was using OnePlus phones prior to this. In short words. The difference between the other phones or even Apple’s cheap phones is the same as the difference between a sleeper class coach in a train and a business class seat on a plane.,iPhone 11 Pro
"I've used iPhone 4S, 6S and the 11 pro. I opted for the 256GB model. I am the most happy with the battery life and camera. Both of them are excellent and state of the art.The camera comes with a multitude of options and you take excellent videos and photos with it. I most times get more than a day of battery life which is really great for an iPhone.This phone doesn't have a touch id but face recognition and in engineering, I think it has done a better job.",iPhone 11 Pro
"Very superb mobile, nice cameras and speed",iPhone 11 Pro
"It has stunning wide angle camera and the results it gives is something you cannot believe. Performs really well in dark light. Night photography is the best. Captured stars at night with 2sec to 10sec exposure. Got bit of noise in the photo, but I’m okay with it. Camera is what puts this mobile in the lead position among all other mobiles in market. If camera is the deal breaker for you, then you can just close your eyes and go for this mobile. You will definitely enjoy it.",iPhone 11 Pro
Have just switched on the phone for the first time after charging for an hour. The phone is getting terribly heated. Seems very abnormal,iPhone 11 Pro
The screen looks stunning and the pro cameras are awesome. Being an Apple user I did not have any second thought about this phone. The midnight green looks stunning and the build quality of this phone is next level.,iPhone 11 Pro
I have upgraded from iPhone X and yeah I was missing the 3D touch. But this phone is sleek stylish and has amazing cameras. I was stunned with the video stabilising software of this phone.,iPhone 11 Pro
Mobile is awesomeBut i not get invoiceSo pls how i get my invoice of my phone,iPhone 11 Pro
The iPhone is overheating and the item is non-returnable and non-refundable. Please stay away from Amazon.,iPhone 11 Pro
"There is no doubt its costly but given the fact its battery and performance doesn’t deteriorate over the period of time as compared to other premium Samsung phones. It’s definitely worth it and if you have any other apple device, you will just love the ecosystem. Specifically this phone has great camera quality, the build is way too good. The stainless steel body, the matt finish back everything just feels too good.",iPhone 11 Pro
The phone in all is value for money.But the battery life is not so impressive.Camera quality is  very good and takes high precision good quality photos and with lots of different modes for clicking photos,iPhone 11 Pro
"Bought this online on 21st October 2019.Sold by Appario and fulfilled by Amazon. The product dispatch and delivery was prompt. Full marks there.A year later, I have noticed that the battery performance is unimpressive on two frontsa) Takes longer to charge than what it shouldb) The phone lasts fewer hours (irrespective of whether in use or idle).The phone-build is commendable and has sustained a few falls.Clearly the chip design is impressive too. I tested this by using my phone as a hotspot, and performed a speed test. I then moved the SIM card to a router and then performed a speed test. Results were contrasting and clearly in favor of the iphone.However, these arent reasons good enough to shell out close to 1 lac INR for a phone, if the expected service duration without issues is just about a year.",iPhone 11 Pro
"Hi,I have purchased in dec and already i can’t hear voice on my earphones , contacted seller sent him follow emails about warranty  but no respond. Please advise",iPhone 11 Pro
"I have been suffering a lot from past 3 months.No one is listening to me in the entire system.the day i got  the product it was opened,the box and the phone  was  damaged.The  phone was also not getting switch on and when the pickup was  created they are goving me false reasons that the product you are returning is not  original. No one  ever came to the address and they denied the  pickup.But any one in amazon can tell that if the product is not getting then how can i justify that it is original or dummy a d if it isdummy as per your statment than you have fooled me by giving a dummy product",iPhone 11 Pro
Don’t buy expensive product from amazon never ever otherwise you people facing problems like me. I purchased this phone with prepaid but they people deliver product with very poor quality. Phone box is looks so dirty old and filthy. Can’t even imagin. And I requested to return this from 2 days back but I didn’t get any positive response still. So I learned a point from there I ‘ll never purchased any costly items from amazon. Never ever,iPhone 11 Pro

"This phone rocks..apple Totally nailed it... earlier I was using realme 3 pro ..than I decided to buy iPhone 11 pro ..at first I was hesitant to buy it because of it's price. But than my uncle suggested me to sell kidneys,if I wanted to buy this . I had to sell both kidneys because one was not enough . Never regretted my decision , such a value for money , whatever u want to do -play games, watch movies etc this phone is best .There is one problem though , uncle is no more 😥",iPhone 11 Pro
NEVER BUY IPHONE 11I purchased this from apple store and from the first start itself there is sevre heating issue . For the last eight months since I purchase this product I am behind the service team and customer care people and there is no satisfactory result .You can buy ten Chinese phone for this price which will work much much better than this .So pls I advisw you all not to go for this product and the customer service is the worst .,iPhone 11 Pro
"I see everything is talking just about camera. Common man go and buy a dslr if you really buying this phone (not a smart phone) for it's camera. This phone lacks in tech. The real tech. I own iphone and android flagship devices. And, believe me, my iphone is under dust for months as it's a useless piece. It hangs a lot. Most of the store apps are either pathetic or paid. The only thing I like about iPhone is its hardware quality.",iPhone 11 Pro
"It is an awesome  beast. In short it is baap of all phones.The camera setup and software support is mind blowing.The battery life is improved a lot,The screen quality is same as iPhone xs.The green colour looks lovely.I loved specially the Ultrawide Angle camera and the Hell of a Beast of a Processor .... A13Bionic , I am a Doctor and the way Apple Presented the Chip on the stage blew my mind ...... that small piece of hardware has 8.5 Billion transistor and based on 7NM architecture ...... ! Finally this is gonna be the beast of a phone and another thing that made me happy Apple might manufacture and assemble these phones in India itself! Kudos Apple You did an Amazing work!",iPhone 11 Pro
"A power packed phone with top class performance.The midnight green colour is the best one .Battery lasts a whole day on moderate use and its display quality is awesome.The three camera setup is really great and I liked the image clarity very much.Few cons which I would like to say is first its too heavy from my previous Iphone Xs.Secondly it is much slippery so we need to use a case always to use which in fact turns it more bulky.Overall the phone is very good and If you can buy go for it.But if you have iphone x , xs or xs max I would not recommend you to buy it as you will just get an extra camera and nothing special.",iPhone 11 Pro
"Fast performance to previous iPhone xGood camera quality but the best part of night mode #killingI am already One-plus7Huge difference between in night mode&iPhones 11 pro winsDisplay is also great in #iPhone 11 proDisappointed —-You can’t be move your data android to iphone , Move to ios app not working in that case.iPhone change his USB type cable, You cant be charge your phone to power bank through this cable.... type c plug replaces USB plug",iPhone 11 Pro

Over priced.. Apple r just money suckers... prefer Samsung a whole lot more,iPhone 11 Pro
It’s barely been 4 months and the phone suddenly died!!! And it’s impossible to get an appointment with the apple service centre. Please help. The phone is completely dead and doesn’t work at all now.,iPhone 11 Pro
"yes it’s to costly, first i hesitate to buy this ,than my mausi said it’s a good product. so to buy this product i had to have a fight with my father, now i’m homeless..! but i was so dedicated to buy this product , so i sold my two kidney as one was not enough..!it’s a great product and camera quality is to high all through their is one problem my mausi is no more..!",iPhone 11 Pro
"This phone (11 Pro, 256GB) replaced a 128GB SE and I can immediately see a big uptick in the signal strength of the phone in places where the SE would not at all function.  This is a huge deal for me.The phone itself is of course superb and I especially like the screen, the face detection and of course the operational speed.  The battery life is also a BIG increase over the SE.Overall, I am very happy with the 11 Pro.  I debated about getting the 11 Pro Max, but decided on the smaller form factor of the 11 Pro.  Very happy with that decision to get the smaller device.",iPhone 11 Pro
Not worth it... now I have to use this mobile for atleast for 3 years. Camera and video is all time good. Battery life is poor. Performance is good.,iPhone 11 Pro
"”Read everything carefully”The phone is the best you can get if you truly want a great phone.Great battery life and perfect size, your hands don’t get tired while holding it and you can easily use it one-handed.Don’t get deceived by the small form factor, the phone has a huge display perfect for gaming and watching HDR content, seems huge compared to my iPhone SE.The Pro Max is truly gigantic for me and more of a phablet than a phone. 20% more battery in the Pro Max than the Pro isn’t a huge setback anyway. I would go for ease of use and same features rather than that little battery difference.Some great features:• 7+ screen on time on max brightness and high usage ( for ref iPhone 7 Plus has close to 4+ hours on same testing )• Truly brightest and most vivid display. (HDR supported). You can easily see everything on the phone pretty clearly even in bright sunlight.• The best camera around in a smartphone. Believe me, pixel is no where close to this considering all the photo capturing and video shooting scenarios. The best part is that most people won’t even notice the difference between the photos captured from this phone and an expensive DSLR.• Pretty LOUD and vivid speakers. Sound-surround literally drives you mad when you first experience it. Even though Oneplus 7t/ 7t Pro also have Dolby Atmos, they aren’t this loud when I tested them.• The best software experience. It has the best chip in a smartphone which when integrated at core level with the software makes the peak use of the chip. No phone in the market is even close to it in terms of performance. Yeah it can have bugs here and there sometimes but they usually get fixed pretty quick and remain assured for software updates for atleast 5+ years.• Signal reception is great because 4x4 MIMO which simply 4 antennas for sending and receiving conpared to 2x2 MIMO on most other phones even the cheaper iPhone 11. You would get good signal in low network areas approx. 2x more than 2x2 MIMO.• Build quality is great, you won’t deny it as it pretty durable material (Steel) and the glass is more durable to breaking ( Still scratches the same )• I don’t consider Touch ID is even required after my 2 weeks time with it. Face ID is much more convenient than Touch ID. Remember times when you’re using your hands for something else like eating or they’re wet, that’s not an issue anymore and Face ID is much more quick than what it used to be in its 1st gen. It’s even pretty secure, can’t be tricked by a picture or even a 3D mask, and you need to glance to unlock, so no one unlocks it while you’re sleeping. (Funny fact for knowledge: Pixel 4’s face authentication doesn’t even require to glance, means your wife can easily spy on you and check all your bad activity while you’re in your dreams)• It has the highest waterproof rating on a smartphone ( For 30 minutes upto 4 metres )But be careful as it doesn’t have water damage warranty. If you get the phone wet, dry it completely before charging and always check the sim tray before splashing any water. I would not recommend washing under a tap as one of my previous phones Sony Xperia Z3 compact( water rating 2m for 30 mins) had gotten water damaged by doing that and the camera lens also became foggy.• Lastly they have significantly improved the charging time. For me, it charges from 0-60% in half an hour with the included 18w adapter and cable ( even more than what they claim)Edit: The first order had a 1mm scratch so I got it replaced.Then the replacement I received had even major issues, defective headphones in the box (which got replaced at the service center) and it was charging slowly on fast charger for like 3 days(0-26% in 30 minutes). Seems the phone was may be setting up in the background. The issue got resolved by itself even without any other update.PRO-TIP: Buy apple made leather case (I bought saddle brown) from an authorised apple store before-hand, it won’t get loose and will age like fine wine, and don’t forget to buy a clear tempered for front panel, which won't hinder brightness and viewing angles, you won't regret it. 😉",iPhone 11 Pro

"Akash here has ranted so much that a whole another essay can be wrote on the same, what he doesn’t know is that A13 is one generation ahead of the finest snapdragon. He also has no idea how to use iphone, which is understandable because he didn’t use it before but comparing it to Pakistan is just dumb.

"Short: Go for it if you can afford.TL;DR;I've been having Apple ecosystem (MBP, Watch, AirPod, iPad and iPhone) for many years.  However, this is my first release day purchase of an Apple device.  Improved camera module in iPhone 11 pro helped me to arrive at this decision and I believe that this is the single most important feature in iPhone 11 pro.  Mainly -- Introduction of new wide angle lens.- Better color reproduction- Night mode (Some online reviews suggested that this can not be changed and is set by Camera app automatically.  This is not true.  You can disable if needed from the selection controls)- 16:9 format (you can set this to default from Settings->Camera->Preserve Settings->Camera Mode).  This is the default in my case- Portrait mode with light settings.  I found that we can take studio quality pictures using this)Here are some images I took at various settings.  You can see the richness of color in each of these photographs.  The first one was in the morning against rising sun.  Look at the accurate exposure on the lawn even with the presence of direct sunlight.  The last one is part of Blue city Jodhpur with Mehrangarh fort in the backdrop.  Though the blue is a bit saturated, it gives a dramatic look for the photos.In addition to Camera, the overall experience is very fluid and effortless (I'm leaving out the iOS13 features as the same is available on older models as well).There are a few drawbacks though. The phone is bit bulkier than previous models.  The advantage is the increased battery life.  I've been able to use the phone for upto 30 hours with over 4 hours of screen time (mainly reading and videos) and close to 1 hour of call.  That's a great improvement compared to previous versions.The second drawback is the price.  But that's the price you pay for quality.  One should be able to use this phone for 4 years at least with OS upgrades and Security updates coming in continuously (Something which I don't see on Android).",iPhone 11 Pro
I am feeling awesome 😎Ordered during prelaunch ...Camera quality is excellent..Battery lasts more than 2 days for a normal net access and most of the time Watsapp and YouTube.Especially this mid night green color resembles our Indian Army 🇮🇳 🙏,iPhone 11 Pro
"This is my replacement for earlier iPhone 5s which I bought 5 years back. Till date that is working fine. The only problem I had with earlier phone was with storage (It is 16GB) and camera.  This one overcomes both the problems with 256GB storage and 3 powerful cameras.  You may not find it awesome if you are upgrading from models for 7 and above.  What I like most about apple products is, You can be 100% confident about reliability and durability. I am sure, I can use this for next 5-6 years without any problem.",iPhone 11 Pro
"I’ve been a Mac user for almost 3 years now I was really happy with the kind of support apple offers on known issues. Also, I’ve always been an android user ever since I started using smartphones until recently when Samsung started really getting on my nerves. Their devices develop either battery or display problems right after the warranty expires. And guess what, I said goodbye to Samsung and android choosing to try out the whole ecosystem of apple instead. I find this phone to be snappy, simple and easy to use and of amazing build quality. It does take a while of getting used to but then at the end I feel it’s worth it.  It’s got a great camera, Face ID accuracy and quite good quite a good battery which should last you all day long.",iPhone 11 Pro
"No words to explain features and quality of this phone, just loving it 😍😍",iPhone 11 Pro
"What I love:1. Amazing battery life - lasts me 1.5 days from full charge2. Great speaker quality3. Superb camera - night mode comes on automatically with the option to control shutter speed4. Form factor - love the small form factor5. Superb display6. Fast charging - so used to this coming from my OnePlus 6T7. Face ID works flawlessly - the fingerprint scanner in my OP6T didn't work most of the time.What I don't like:1. No USB-C - this is a major pain since the supplied charger and earphones only need to be lightning port compatible. Can't use any other charger or earphone. Luckily I have my Sony headphones which I use with Bluetooth2. Flimsy quality of the charger wire - feels too fragile - should have been metal sheathed and strong.3. Flimsy quality of the earphone wire4. Price5. Lack of good usability of apps - e.g. no way to mark Messages as 'read' from the notifications center. You need to clear the notifications, then go to Messaging app and open each and every message. Considering that most messages are OTPs, etc. this functionality should be a no-brainer.Overall, I love the phone.",iPhone 11 Pro
Pro model is for camera lovers onlyHave a very good battery backupI am businessman and lover of photographySo i shared some photos taken by this phonePhone is outstanding and will give you especially the gold model a super luxury feeling to you.You will feel a tremendous speed while using or switching apps.The phone is handy one hand use and also the back side has a matte finish which gives a good grip in your hands.I purchased and suggest to buy 256gb variant only.And no doubt i am ex android user but this phone won my heart I switched from oneplus 6t to iphone 11 pro.,iPhone 11 Pro
"Overall a good buy. Dissaponting thing is the resolution and no way to be able to change the number of icons to fit in a single row, which seems to be 4 max. I regretted not buying a Iphone 11 pro max, but after realising, it also has the same resolution(number of icons to be fit in a single row), I am not entirely dissapointed. Also some apps like egencia do not work on this phone properly, due to the same resolution issues. My Old Iphone 6 plus does a way better job but it died after 5 years of splendid usage.",iPhone 11 Pro
"It was best decision to buy this I loved it. Previous I was using iPhone SE 1st edition which is still in working condition however I was looking for an upgrade and buying iPhone 11 Pro was best decision...It's fast, It stays for long 1charge in 24 hours. Camera is obviously awesome",iPhone 11 Pro

"Guys who were using android phones until now will throw bad reviews.. that’s obvious because you gotta understand the new software .But one who has seen or explored iOS will never ever want to get out of the system .. it’s secure, super fast , very reliable , solid built phone.No matter what your profession is .. doctor , engineer, architect, banker, etc. this phone is superb and very very secure for business personals who do a lots of online transactions or whatever.If lost , NOT like android phone you go to the shop pay 100 Rs and unlock the phone , NOBODY except you can unlock the iPhone not even FBI could do it.New iOS user get to the YouTube , search for iOS tips and learn how to use it .I’m using is for like 6 years and used android parallel and once my money from my bank account was debited for 3 days in a row .. I went to bank and they said your credit card is hacked . If you are using android phone please switch to iPhone if you do online transactions. I’m like wtf .. immediately sold my Samsung galaxy phone . ANDROID on mobile is like a windows on PC.  No matter how much security updates they provide each month, it can be hacked easily.",iPhone 11 Pro
"I agree the phone is great because of A13 bionic which is indeed better than Snapdragon 855 plus even if A13 bionic got a lower clock speed compared to the 855 plus, their os is well optimized too and their camera goes well with the software. Having an LCD screen with 60Hz refresh rate doesn't bother many. But the price is too insane for what they are giving. One can buy an Android flagship at half the price and would still be get pretty similar features.",iPhone 11 Pro
"iphone 11 pro is now one of the best phones in the market in 2020 . In my opinionI think it is even better than Google pixel 4. And it also hasa new triple camera system. But it is manly based on your preference of what you want in a good phone. If it is the camera or better battery life you can go for the iPhone 11 Pro without any doubt but if you prefer a cheaper one you can go for the iPhone 11 because, iPhone 11 has a dual camera but it's half the price of the iPhone 11 pro.",iPhone 11 Pro
"I am posting review after few days of usage👇👇Display:- It has an Oled Panel,so I think there is no need to explain anything...Camera:-Best Camera it will never disappoint you..Processor:-It's Apple A13 Bionic Chip which is faster then Snapdragon and you will never face any issues in any app & games like Instagram,YouTube & Pubg...UI:-Love the UI,it's so good looking UI...Accuracy:-Buttery smooth and no lags...Durability:-It come with stainless steel framing...Battery Backup:-Battery life is improved and now it will give you a good battery backup...Waterproof:-Yes Its waterproof...Final review:-According to me if you want a premium looking smartphone with best camera,processor and best display then you should buy this...",iPhone 11 Pro

I pre ordered the item on sept 21 and received ok 2 Oct . It was in iOS 13 . It is buttery smooth and nice and there was an update of ios13.1.2 available. But after updating I stuck in Apple logo. I could not create a return in Amazon as it's asked me to contact Apple. I wonder why is that.,iPhone 11 Pro Max

Many time even home screen was hanged( i have installed only five additional apps quora, amazon, facebook, whatsapp and google maps). Please refrain from purchasing this phone. It is waste of money.",iPhone 11 Pro Max

"I was using iPhone XS Max, but now after having iPhone 11 Pro Max - I can say it is fabulous and outstanding. Perfect as always, performance is too good.Night mode is better than any available camera, Pixel 4 XL, Mate 30 Pro and Note 10+.This device is unbeatable (until next iPhone).",iPhone 11 Pro Max
"I Love the iPhone Pro Max, purchased from Amazon IN, on Oct 14th 2019. This space grey 64 GB base model was delivered to me on Oct 19th. Here are my objective views about this phone:What I didnt like:1. Obviously the price tag. At Rs. 1,09099.00 is a major deterrent when it comes to decide on buying a phone.2. The base model should certainly begin at 128 GB or higher. 64 GB is not gonna be enough when storing 4K videos.3. Optical zoom in camera is still 2X, where as Android phones already have 5X zooms.Now about what I love in this phone:1. The Camera. That is the main reason I upgraded from iPhone X to 11 Pro Max. The Ultrawide lens, the improved telephoto lens, night mode, improved portrait options, all give exceptional results. The snaps taken by this phone could compete with some of the most professional DSLRs. 4K video recording support on front camera is an additional bonus.2. Battery Life. All the reviews have been right about this. I used to charge my iPhone X every night, whereas for the same amount of usage, now I have to charge the 11 Prod max once in 2 nights.3. Display. I was already a big fan of the 5.8' OLED display on the iPhone X. At 6.5' , 11 Pro Max offers the best OLED display I have come across smartphones.4. Face ID is faster. The apps and the interface work smoothly as ever.5. iOS 13, though still needs fixes, is a wonderful operating system. Dark mode is a welcome change.Overall, this is a beast. Admire Apple for catching up with its android counterparts on several of the features. The 11 Pro Max is definitely a phone for amateur & professional photographers.",iPhone 11 Pro Max

"I am coming from galaxy note 10 and all time android user, so I already have a taste of premium devices.This felt more premium, the body felt solid, but ergonomically this phone is a mess, its heavy, too wide to grip comfortably but it has this weird solid feel to it.Apart from this everything just works, bluetooth connectivity is godly, battery is like nothing else, camera is great, doesnt even sweat playing pubg at hdr extreme. Slowdowns what are those?If you want the best this is it.CONS:1) Note 10's display is way better, yes this display is more natural but that felt way good to eyes, ios should give a vivid profile. True tone is bs2) Why you so wide and heavy phonePros:1) it just works, everything just works and works the best unlike ray tracing on turing",iPhone 11 Pro Max

Heating issue to high,iPhone 11 Pro Max
"My device is showing as non covered warranty, even I purchased it only 2 months ago",iPhone 11 Pro Max
green colour is awsm,iPhone 11 Pro Max
"This is the iPhone having a battery which allows the phone to be used with all its glory for at least 12 hours if not 15 hours without recharging it. However the battery discharge is slightly more, after the recent updates. Camera is excellent. Overall. it is simply an IPhone, no other phone can match the experience.",iPhone 11 Pro Max
"For two-three years, Android phones were churning out better photos than the iPhone. With the iPhone 11 Pro Max, Apple has reclaimed the top spot in smartphone photography and how!Pros:THE CAMERA-• Images are sharper than ever before without destroying the natural textures, white balance more accurate and night mode brightens the nigh time photos without taking the essence from the night scene away. Colours are accurate at the cost of looking desaturated at times. But the images will appeal to those with a trained eye. It’s not for those who are easily wowed by the over-sharpened, aggressively noise-reduced, extra bright, hyper-saturated and overexposed photos of Samsung flagships.• Deep fusion on the iOS 13.3 update has brought wonders to the image processing game and it will push other manufacturers to take note and improve. Layers of underexposed and one overexposed images are stacked by the processor and The software sharpens the things that need to be sharpened like threads on clothing, texture on bricks etc.• Lens flare still persists and often images in bright sunshine can suffer from lens flare issues.• Video recordings remains the benchmark on iPhones and this year the gap between other brands and the iPhone has widened further. This phone can record 4K on all four cameras! Front and rear. And that too in glorious 60fps.THE BATTERY-• Never has an iPhone lasted more than a day for me with average to heavy use.Just know that this is a battery beast and won’t let you down. Apple has increased the thickness and removed the 3D Touch layer giving exceptional battery life to this phone.FAST CHARGER INCLUDED-• This year the 11 pro and pro Max come with an 18w charger and USB-C to lightning cable in the box. Much needed relief and no more painful slow charging times of 3+ hours. The iPhone 11 (non-pro) still comes with a measly 5w charger.MATTE FINISH GLASS-• This changes the look of the phone, hides the fingerprints and scratches much better and the matte finish plays with the light very well giving a shiny reflectivity to the phone when held against flattering light.THE DISPLAY-• Now brighter in direct sunlight up to 1200 nits and is better calibrated for HDR content. Apple continues to excel at display calibration. No complaints of OLED burn-in and image retention.FASTEST PROCESSOR ON THE MARKET-• The A13 Bionic smashes the benchmarks and makes the competition look ancient by comparison.• Excellent gaming performance in graphics intensive games like Asphalt 9, Fortnite, Pubg, Modern Combat 5 etc. This phone offers 60fps gaming in an ever increasing catalogue of games for iOS.Cons:• Low base storage @ 64GB• iOS 13 is buggy• Super expensive in India.• Expensive to repair physical damage to screen or back glass - the back glass costs approx 40,000/- to replace!!! UNBELIEVABLE!!FINAL THOUGHTS-An excellent offering by Apple.• The best camera on the market.• The best battery ever in an iPhone by a huge margin.• Unrivalled performance.• The phone with the most longevity in terms of hardware quality and software support. Typically 5 years of iOS updates. Samsung are you listening?****Should you upgrade if you have an iPhone XS Max?****I’d say the battery improvements alone warrant an upgrade plus you get an excellent and much improved camera. Well, I’d say it depends on your finances and how much you manage to get for your old phone in trade-in value. If you get a good deal, the iPhone 11 Pro Max is worth it.",iPhone 11 Pro Max
"I broke my iphone 11 so bought the 11 pro max, so you could say that im upgrading from the iPhone 11.The display is bright and crisp as you would expect from apple, BUT its not as good as the display on the samaung galaxy s10 plus or even note 10 plus.If youre looking for the beat display in a phone you should buy the flagship phone of samsung, and yes I know apple uses samsung displays but still I found the s10’s display MUCH MUHC MUCH BETTER.The battery life is exceptionally long lasting which is usually not expected from apple. Even the fast charger charges the phone in about an hour and the battery easily lasts 12 hours of continuous use.The camera is good BUT the the wide angle lens really needs a lot of light to capture sharp images or else youll see a lottt of noise in the image and would look grainy. Night mode is really good I could day best in the segment.We really dont need to discuss about the processor and performance. Apple despite always having less ram is still much much faster in opening apps and overall ios is a lot more smoother than android and unlike androids, youll get frequent software updates for like 4 years.The display could have been a bit more punchy with more saturated colors like samsung, otherwise its a superb phone and if you afford it you should really go for it.",iPhone 11 Pro Max
"Only network issues.. network Signal always less.. so after purchase of huge money.. and poor signal quality., then it’s doesn’t deserve such expensive",iPhone 11 Pro Max
Camera is the best part,iPhone 11 Pro Max
"It’s my first iOS Device after my Macbook and I’m simply Amazed with it. I’ve use almost every flagship android like pixel and galaxy notes and no one comes close to this. Cameras and Battery is absolutely top notch, Design, weight, Notifications are could be little better but I’m pretty happy with my decision to going with this.",iPhone 11 Pro Max
"Wow, this phone is a beast. No wonder why it’s priced so high. It’s the father of all phones... To top that I must mention Amazon’s super fast express delivery. The phone was delivered to me in flat 4.5 hours after ordering. Now coming to this beast phone.Pros: 1. This has the best camera features as compared to any other phone. The best feature is the night vision camera.2. The batter life is much better than other apple phone’s.3. The price is high but that is expected of iphone. Either you can buy it or you cannot. That depends on individuals budget.Cons: 1. The only thing bad is the weight. But then I purchased 256 GB and that will be bulky.My personal experience says this phone is a must buy.",iPhone 11 Pro Max
Product is awesome. First time I am using iPhone. Plus points are battery life and user interface. It never fails to do tasks you throw at and is always consistent in performance. This is where most of android devices lack. Screen quality is good and Retina display is really you will appreciate as compared to other premium android phones display. It just looks different in better way. The design is no doubt good although it’s heavy but easy to handle. Standby battery life is great. For Standby of 6-7 hours with WiFi connected Bluetooth on it only decreases marginally by 1-4%. Overall too much better than custom android user interfaces and android usability.,iPhone 11 Pro Max
Very much impressive it’s my first experience in using apple very happy,iPhone 11 Pro Max
The true machine !! Ultimately you can say the best iPhone ever made !! Full day battery !! Best in the class display !! Night mode should be better !! Best ever iPhone to upgrade !!11 Pro max rocks,iPhone 11 Pro Max
I upgraded from a 6s plus to this phone. Apple has made a phone worth a lac and a half for the top version however Apple has to think a lot on the external appearance of the phone and its features. The cameras and battery are no doubt outstanding. But the diagonal width has been stretched to 6.5 inch and the width has remained constant making the phone very long and narrow and lowering the aesthetic look. Moreover the phone display is cut out at the top where the sensors and front camera is placed. Apple should have introduced more features and Apps considering such an expensive phone.,iPhone 11 Pro Max
Have been an apple customer for 7 years now and this is my 7th apple product. My 3 day old iPhone 11 Promax has already developed a glitch. The screen lock button doesn’t work sometimes. It’s so irritating. Have been trying to call Apple support and the earliest appointment for the call us 6th sept. Really. Sometimes I feel Apple’s performance is over rated for the money it charges.,iPhone 11 Pro Max
A little heavy but very nice,iPhone 11 Pro Max
After  1 month use: Battery life is is excellent. Camera gives natural colours. It could have inscreen finger print. Audio quality is excellent for dual speakers for stereo effect. Screen mirroring difficult as your tv should have Apple airplay. Also you can not stream some content of Apple TV through AirPlay.  IOS is smooth to handle. But there is always some restrictions. Apps are pricy.,iPhone 11 Pro Max

"I will not cover any technical terms like “fps”, “aperture”, “hdr”, “geekbench” and all that.This review will only be in a very basic Format.So let’s get started.It’s a costly phone. Probably the costliest. If you think you can “invest” this much amount in a phone, then go ahead with reading the review. If not, please exit.Now coming to why I used the word “invest” instead of “spend” is that iPhone is the best phone as a commodity.  You can get very good resale value of any iPhone even after 3-4yrs.Why? Because Apple takes care of their old models as well. Because the hardware and software integration is top notch.Coming to this particular phone:It’s something which you would cherish using. The fluidity of iOS13 in a device this big with the best smartphone camera on the planet will just blow you away.Now “best Smartphone camera” is a debatable topic. I will not go into that. Would just say that there are very good smartphone cameras out there which capture brilliant photos. But this iPhone captures ACTUAL photos. You would see actual skintone, actual colors, actual variance.I have attached some photos taken from this iPhone which are untouched and unedited. You can see for yourself.Now, let’s do the traditional pros and cons:PROs :1) Huge Screen. Great display.2) Gaming : Top notch. No lag. No heating even after 4hrs of continuous FIFA/Asphalt/CoD/Minecraft/SanAndreas/WWE on full brightness.3) Battery Life : Monstrous. 2day easily with moderate usage (writing review after 8 months of usage). 1.2 - 1.5 days with heavy usage.4) Dual SIM / eSIM : Flawless.5) Camera : BEST in the world. Night mode is a charm. You won’t find a better night mode. Ultra wide is a game changer. Video is awesome in 1080p and 4K both6) Display : Excellent. Crisp and clear.7) Flash and Night photography : Just check my attached photos.8) Connectivity/Calls : Fabulous. Speaker is loud as well. Stereo makes it one of the best ones out there.9) Face ID : Works like a charm. Better than my previous X for sure. Angles have improved. It can detect mask as well these days with iOS13.5 and gets you quickly to passcode screen.CONs:1) Big phone. Buy only if you have big hands. Else go for the Pro version (Not Max)2) Front Camera : Not so good in dark and low light. Just above average.3) Phone is bulky. Again, if you are used to lightweight phones, this is not for you.4) Value for Money : I would say NO. The reason being that this phone is sold for 20-30k less in USA. If you purchase from India it’s definitely not VFM.In conclusion, I would just say that Apple has done a tremendous job with this iPhone. It is something you would love and not just use. Even if you don’t buy it, just visit an Apple Store and spend some good 15mins with this phone and you’ll understand what I’m talking about.",iPhone 11 Pro Max
"I have been a big fan of premium phonesTherefore I have used Samsung's S10 plus, OnePlus 7 pro, Samsung's Note 10 Plus and Finally iphone 11 pro maxNow the thing is I really liked Oneplus but I would discard it because it does not have wireless charging and secondly is not waterproof which all the 3 phones have (Samsung and Apple) so here bye OnePlusNow it's all about Samsung vs Apple what i felt using all the 3 phones is *SAMSUNG NOTE 10 PLUS IS A BEAST*  seriously note 10 plus is better than S10 plus as well as from i11 pro max whether it is the display, UI customization, looks, camera etc etcI know that A13 chip is most powerful chip but believe me you won't be able to use it to the fullest ever (until and unless you are a big businessman or something like that)Price vice note 10 plus would be a great option will not give a huge load on your pocket and you'll really love the device as wellSo don't waste your more than 1 lac rs in iPhone it's your hardcore earned money 💸💵💴💶💰💳",iPhone 11 Pro Max
Kideny price phone but doesnt have better display,iPhone 11 Pro Max
"I always check the latest phone before I buy, and believe me I have always rejected iPhones for very poor camera. I have personally tested the camera and I'm totally disappointed. In fact, I have not yet found a better camera than the one I have on Reno 10X Zoom ! Try it , test it, compare it and you'll believe me...",iPhone 11 Pro Max
"You Have to Love APPY because they not only make amazing product they make Jaduu ....... I loved specially the Ultrawide Angle camera and the Hell of a Beast of a Processor .... A13Bionic , I am a Disco Dancer and the way Appy Presented the Chip on the stage blew my mind ..I started doing Disco Disco...... my 8 inch piece of hardware has 18.5 Billion transistor and based on 7NM architecture ...... simple word its like a Fizzy Bubblech and other drinks are Cola mola ! Finally this is gonna be the beast of a telephone and another thing that made me happy Appy might manufacture and assemble these phones in India itself! Kudos Apple You did an Amazing work! Your the Best!",iPhone 11 Pro Max

don't buy very high budget phone from them it may be reopend boxthis case is happened with many phonesyou should buy from this apple store,iPhone 11 Pro Max
"I wanted to buy a phone. I had one old Maruti Zen and a Yamaha bike. I sold both of them for Rs 1 lakh and took a loan for the balance amount. I purchased this beast. Now I play car and bike racing games and let me tell you the experience is outstanding. Never noticed any lag, as I was irritated that my old car and bike never used to start sometimes and had engine issues. Absolute beast. What a great decision i took. In addition wonderful fingerprint reader, battery life and face recognition also.",iPhone 11 Pro Max
"Ok so let me get its straight! Its an iPhone so the operating system is same as all others iPhones..whats different is camera, screen, battery life. Its just excellent..if you really into upgrading go for maximum GB space so that you can carry the phone for some more years cos this phone has a good built and it will last long!Model: IPhone 11 Pro Max 512GB",iPhone 11 Pro Max
I Am Speechless Y'all Should Buy This One.It clicks the best picture no need to buy any camera lol just kidding but if you're looking for something new and Improved y'all should Buy 😉 Hope This Review helped you.,iPhone 11 Pro Max
"The only chinks in the armour surface from a lacklustre iOS 13 release, which although has some great features, is currently under a lot of stress and duress with some major bugs creeping into the software, the most important being the non-working of the ever so ubiquitous Reminders app. But that is only a passing phase as the rollout of major releases with bug fixes should fix most problems in the coming few days, in the coming few weeks and in the coming few months. But in any case, that simply does not take anything away from iPhone 11 Pro Max, its a wonderful smartphone that should suffice the needs of most new users as well as those of most brand loyalists alike. Apple has finally delivered an uber cool device after a few sombre years where the company's growth seemed to had hit a plateau. The iPhone 11 Pro Max, even though not being too innovative, is arguably the best premium smartphone in the market available by far for almost everything that a smartphone should be and the phone should give Apple a sizeable lead over its main competitors, Samsung and OnePlus, now that Huawei has hit a roadblock. But in all, you cannot go wrong with the iPhone 11 Pro Max, so you shouldn't think twice while buying this smartphone, it is indeed a very fruitful investment!!",iPhone 11 Pro Max

What a phone,iPhone 11 Pro Max
"What has improved in the new iphones  ?? 1. Camera.. 2. Battery life..You have to sacrifice a lot of things if you are moving from an android to iphone.You can forget about things like call recording, direct video calling, file manager, headphone jacks etc..Only move from an android to iphone if you want a good video camera... all other things you can get on a good android phone. ( pixel still is the best phone for taking photos but not videos)And if you are living in India, you are better off with android.",iPhone 11 Pro Max
Apple this year is learning from their mistakes in the past.,iPhone 11 Pro Max
"It’s a good phone. The box was all dusty and so was the phone inside. Suppose it had been opened for checking or something prior. Plus it’s old, date of import on the box is October 2019 so almost 10 months old. The MRP on the box is 1,41,900 and sold on Amazon for about 5,000 higher after a credit card discount, that’s not fair. I would recommend buying straight from an Apple store anyday. I had to buy it on Amazon from Appario retail because we’re still staying home due to COVID.",iPhone 11 Pro Max
"Have had a very good experience with this phone so far. The screen size, and over all touch and feel is amazing. It feels really well made and top quality. You can feel the Apple quality.The battery life is amazing, earlier iPhones I would need to charge by 6 in the evening. This phone gives me 16 - 18 hours of use everyday with about 4 hours activity per day between phone calls, and different apps.The single best feature of this phone is the camera. No other phone comes close. The detail and resolution is spectacular. Especially the night mode.Have done a few (not scientific) trials of taking the same photo simultaneously with friends who have flagship smart phones of other brands, and even the most anti apple people also admit that the photos and amazing.You don’t buy an Apple flagship phone for value for money, yes there are many phones that are good and may be far cheaper, but... it’s not an iPhone",iPhone 11 Pro Max
"Shifted from a google  pixel 2xl love the rear camera on the iPhone but I miss the night sight on the front camera, have figured out ways to download torrent movies and watch them on vlc player. Besides that I love the continuity feature as I own a iPad too answering calls in the iPad when my phone isn’t with me is super convenient. I’m a spec lover but I believe in function over show off. So as a tech lover I can’t say you get what you pay for but I can surely say you get best the mobile industry has to offer. To top it all the battery life is just outstanding 2 days of heavy usage",iPhone 11 Pro Max
"iPhone 11 Pro Max is an outstanding product. Apple has designed every aspect incl packaging with quality and inspiration in mind for the user. The product is wow with an effortless way of wirelessly transferring data from existing iPhone. So in no time you are ready to get started. Every aspect of finding your way around the way and it's applications is intuitive which makes this phone an outstanding one. All technical specs are market leading - processor, camera, form factor, battery, super retina xdr oled touchscreen. It's a little heavier though it doesn't create a problem.",iPhone 11 Pro Max
Android is way better. People these days are so inclined towards showing off that they could even buy dust with a apple logo for one lakh.,iPhone 11 Pro Max
Screen is pealing off after six months.,iPhone 11 Pro Max
"As usual it’s yet another great phone from Apple other than the price it’s 5 stars....Differences from the previous model,1) Charges much faster2) camera is better3) Haptic Touch instead of 3D4) is faster.",iPhone 11 Pro Max
"Top class phone altogether. Loved each bit of this beast. I am amazed by the battery back up. I think the only phone that can give it a competition in terms of quality is Samsung Note 10.  Photo clarity is the best among all the iPhone models till date. Price is a bit miss in India. Extremely costly. But, after you get this in your hand, then you can stay relaxed.",iPhone 11 Pro Max

"Its just a gimmick!! Is what you get is not what you pay, no fast charging and still display with big notch while phones with just 30000 are charging 0-100 in 30 minutes and I will never buy Apple to make it rich, I only buy their shares lol which will make me rich. As technology advances I don't mind buying a 30000 phone every year than buying a 123000 phone for three year with old tech (people who wants to show themselves as rich people and use this phone as status symbol can just ignore this comment ,)",iPhone 11 Pro Max
"Excellent device, yes its expensive but quality is top notch and I chose midnight green colour because its new and it’s growing on me. Bought it from Unicorn at the release date. Screen is a treat to the eye, Cameras are awesome, both front and rear. Night mode is fabulous (photos attached). Battery backup is great. Performance is mind blowing, Its blazing fast, handles anything you throw at it. Perfect phone and after IOS update 13.2 its got even better. Specially camera with deep fusion, resulting images are now with better texture, details and reduced noise especially in low light conditions.",iPhone 11 Pro Max

   Another beauty from Apple. I was upgraded from iPhone X and it was great experience with all the latest specs and flawlessly smooth. Thanks to all new A14 Bionic chip.Build quality was great as always from Apple.Phone feels light on hands due to aluminium body. I chose Blue colour because wanted to go for different colour than routine Black and white iPhones so initially I was bit skeptical but after seeing the phone in person I’m happy with the blue colour  “ not bad at all and not too flashy”Grip and feel perfect. Phone comes with iOS 14.1. Camera quality was excellent and sufficient  as a normal user.If you are from iOS ecosystem nothing will go wrong here.There is nothing to question about the quality and interface from Apple ( it’s my personal opinion as a long time apple user)As you all know iPhone 12 won’t comes with earphones and charging brick( adapter)I bought separately 20w apple adapter from new Apple India online store for Rs.1900I don’t judge here apple because of accessories removal and the price tag. I hope apple can justify this.I only hope and wanted to see so badly Made in India IPhones so that we all can enjoy lower priced ( at least a better priced) iPhones in the future.A big thanks to Appario Retail Pvt. Ltd and Amazon for delivering genuine iPhone as always in perfect condition. Delivered way before the promised date.Update: (01/12/2020) After testing 25 days especially on battery life of this iPhone 12, results were amazing and I’m completely satisfied  with the battery performance. On Moderate gaming, Moderate Video Content, heavy on calls and heavy on browsing this iPhone 12 battery life is sufficient for your regular Day.My conclusion is definitely a better and improved battery performer than the previous iPhone model.Thank you Apple IndiaThank you Appario Retail Pvt. Ltd.Thank you Amazon India.( Note: charger brick was shown in my video was bought myself from Apple India online store because it won’t comes with the phone)",iPhone 12
"This was my first switch to an ios device after using an android untill now. And I am not disappointed. The build quality, the responsive touch, the display, the camera, the battery life are just exceptional.Been using for about 10 days now, and consistently giving around 7h of screen on time.The camera is just way too good. Espeecially the night mode impressed me a lot.Only issue when switching from Android to iPhone I encountered was to be not able to restore my whatsapp chats. There are no official/free ways for doing this.The phone is simple amazing.",iPhone 12
Nicely packed !! Kudos to seller !!I was very much confused between iphone 11 and this one as the price of iphone dropped ... But i am glad i chose this over iphone 11.1.Display:Main upgrade in iphone 12 is the oled display. Boy o boy the screen is amazing. I have user many android flagship's but this beats them all.2.Battery:Battery is amazing. I am getting 1.5 days of battery life with my usage.PS: i dont play games.3.IOS:This is my 1st iphone and the experience with ios is great ... Very smooth animations ..even though its not 90hz screen but everything is buttery smooth.4. Camera:The pics from this phone is superb. FLAGSHIP LEVEL CAMERA! You will not be dissapointed.5 Build &Design :This phone looks and feels very premium compared to other phones.Very comfotable to use.6.Face Id:Face id works very fast and accurate in low lighting conditions.7.Updates:Ios14 is good and we can expect another 4yrs of software  updates thats huge !Cons:1.Priced very high but it may be because of high taxes and custom duty.2.No charger and earpods in the box.3.Notifications are a mess ...android is better in managing new notifications.Overall a great Phone IF You are OK with the Price !!!,iPhone 12
"Hello there,I am writing this review after 3-4 days of usage, Iphone 12 is a beast in terms of:-MemoryBuild qualityCameraProcessorDisplayExcept battery there’s rumour going on that iPhone 12 battery is bad or worst, so i am here to clarify all your doubts,iPhone battery will last easily a day but not more than that and here’s some condition that you should aware about1. If you are using your phone on wifi than it will last a day easily without any problem.2. If you are on 4g than it will not last a day for example, if you fully charged your phone at 8 am than it will last till 8 pm not more than that and this happen if you’re on 4g continuously otherwise it will last about 10 pm.Here’s some tip you should do after buying iPhone 12, watch video on YouTube to know “How to save battery on iPhone 12” this will help you increase your battery life as well battery health.For my experience, i think you should go for this device without any second thoughts & those who don’t have any tech knowledge and thinking of buying this then I recommend you to go for android because iOS has complicate settings than android...you will regret after buying it.Got original product Btw!!!!!",iPhone 12
Same like the old classic iphone 5 lookBut now difference is only6.1 inch display or The A 14 bionic chipAnd oled Hd display,iPhone 12
"I am writing this review after 40 days of use of iPhone 12. phone camera is excellent like DSLR ,very fast processor ,face ID feature looks great ,overall everything is fine but only issue which this phone has is , battery draining too fast. You can use 100% battery only for 5-6 hours of continuous use after that you have to charge it. Apple should look into this.",iPhone 12
"I am writing this after a week of my usage with this iPhone 12. I have had the X before and OnePlus 6T as well.Overall experience of switching to iOS again is so good. The Interface, the speed, smoothness, camera, support, and everything is so well crafter.I’ll be talking about the pros and cons with respect to the apple standards of course.Pros:1. The design is absolutely wonderful, its very very light weight and premium feeling phone with vintage boxy look.2. The speed, the performance.3. Camera of course. The normal picture comes out pretty good, they don’t usually need any professional touch.4. Battery life - I’ll talk about the battery life in day to day life instead of nerdy Screen On Time. I am a doctor and usually don’t play much games on this but I surf web a lot, youtube videos, social media and a lot of WhatsApp and sometimes heavy use for 10% of the time. It can get through one day pretty easily with around 8-9 hr Screen on time, 10hr Stand by time, so you can relate now. Don’t believe that it has bad battery, it has a pretty good battery.ConsNothing much until now.The back of the phone is fingerprint magnet, attracts a lot of them.Another concern was the charging adapter which is not provided in the box.",iPhone 12
"Positives: Very fast, Picture Quality, video quality seems superb,  less charging time required.Cons: Shorter battery life than specified and expected.",iPhone 12
"Sold kidney bought this, now not feeling well but the number of days I am alive with one kidney will enjoy using this phone. Guys be careful if you rich it’s ok else sell something else but not kidney it hurts",iPhone 12
"Its my First Apple device. Happy to own it after a long confusion between iPhone 11 and 12. I believe, it was worth waiting for 12.Received it on 04-Nov-2020. Working well till now. Checked Service Support Coverage. Its a genuine product.AndiPhone in white color is legend.Update after 1 month approx.-----------------------------------After using it for a month I am in love with this phone. Too smooth and I forgot what is lagging...Battery backup is very good and lasts one and half day easily with normal usage. I charge my phone when the battery is around 30%. Battery health is 100% after a month.Camera is awesome and gives very nicely detailed pictures with true colors.Phone speakers are really great and warm. They are loud but don't shout. Listening music or watching videos are enjoyable without earphones too.4G speed better than other 4g phones I have.Worth every penny.",iPhone 12
"Really happy with the purchase. But 2x zoom missing does make a little difference. Performance, Display, camera and battery are on point and that what matters the most to me. I was planning on buying the pro model but this year it was insanely expensive. So Bought this and saved some money for decent accessories. The value for money is great for the 128gb version.",iPhone 12
Great battery life. Love the white colour. Blue is super hyped. It is a finger print magnet.There’s something about the design of these phones. No android phone can match the aesthetics. Except some curved display screens.Upgraded from iPhone 8. I am very very happy.Wish it was a bit cheaper. Bought with 6k instant hdfc discount and 6 months no cost emi.128gb.,iPhone 12
"Amazing iPhone, worthy updatehave to buy a type-c supported charging adaptor for charginggood displaydecent battery lifenice night clicksoverall worthy upgrade from classic iPhonebuy apple original 20w adaptor for charging, it fill battery faster than any other adaptor",iPhone 12
"Overall it looks good, coming from XR it looks a good upgrade for me. Design is ‘back to basics’ which is compelling. I loved the fast response among other things.",iPhone 12
Face id not proper  working Bluetooth fully not working  after 20days date of purchasing,iPhone 12
They called ceremic shield but it’s not for scratchless!!!!! I have so many scratches in my phone.......pls use tempered glass for protection of scratches!!!!!,iPhone 12
"Upgraded for iPhone XR. Battery lasts almost the same as XR but iPhone adapts as per usage over time so it will take time. Which anyways it lasts me for around 1.5 day with normal use and data services and location services always on. Do check the YouTube video to make necessary changes in settings for battery optimisation. Nothing beats the camera performance and let alone the video performance. Phone factor (rectangular edges) feels good to hold however even the MagSafe back cover when put on ruins the fun. Instead try buying a thin screen guard for back of the phone and tempered glass for the front glass as both front and back of the phone seem to be delicate and a costly affair when planning repairs. Overall the performance is great. The backup for Mini is pathetic, buy only if you have very minimal use of the phone. If a telephoto photography doesn’t seem to be on your agenda then this is a smart choice over the pro model.",iPhone 12
"I was an avid android user for past 25 years. This move to IPhone 12 was a calculative yet bolder definitive move. Let’s look at the some of key pointers here what I saw - Stunning design, smooth app flow, battery life is optimal (best in my usage) and the camera is just bringing the life to all the captures you make. I am using Apple 20w charger which is insane at charging 20-25 percent in 7 mins. So, In 15 mins, you are having half the battery up. Love the border outlay of this beauty. It’s nearly not a week for me but I can boldly say, “The best switch one can make”. I know the price tag is always richer but then you are choosing a long term reliability. Kudos to Apple Inc and Amazon for amazing delivery in 2 days.*Please avoid playing Apple Arcade games as they would drain you battery like anything. In my best guess, It is not rightly optimised for it.*What I come to see is why Apple looked for environmental protection by removing charger and earphones. I guess it should come at a reasonable price then. It really put me off but then you know what the market player is serving.",iPhone 12
"When the iPhone 11 prices were announced, I was in a dilemma whether to go for the 11 or wait for 12. And since it was my first iPhone, I thought why not get the 12. The logic being: The phone will last for a couple of years (provided you don't drop it often), and if you are looking for a phone for a long time horizon, then go for the 12. This one with the better chip and the display will be able to handle the upcoming updates as well the apps which will get even more intensive in the future.All technical specs are really good, display is an OLED one, even visible in extreme sunlight. Build quality is miles apart, my brother uses a Samsung Galaxy Note 10+, and holding this one is way way out of the leagues of all the android phones. Processor and RAM are capable of even running multiple intensive applications, I had Adobe LightRoom, iMovie, and a couple of apps open, all to slide between them seamlessly. The trick here is that since apps are only made for a very few iPhones and iOS versions, these apps are hardware integrated, hence work better. A classic example is Instagram. Instagram does feel a bit more polished on the iPhone than android. FaceID even works when there's no light, so thats that. But it can't identify you with the mask, you're left to the PIN when you're in the outside.The Battery: Yes it has a smaller battery, yes with intensive use it will run out in a day, but if you are a bit prudent with it, it'll definitely last for more than a day. I use 4G in between, outdoor photography a bit, editing, email, Apple Music, Youtube, WhatsApp and Instagram. By the end of the day (7:00 PM) , I usually have 40 percent remaining.So yes, its an iPhone and yes its really something nice to hold and use daily.",iPhone 12
12 vanilla is the phone to buy for the average user. Its the sweet spot for 🍎 fans. If you really want the 3 cameras go for the pro max.,iPhone 12
"Pros:there are 1000s of blog for prosCons:Apple has to work to improve their battery lifeCharger ! Charger ! Charger ! If apple really cares about environment so much then they must deliver a phone once in 3 years. Or, give the users a usb c.Don’t rely on their screen advertising. Use a cover. Glass is still a glass and you can observe scratches after a month of usage.5g isn’t for India, still price in terms of dollars was same!",iPhone 12
Good product it is little bit smaller than iphone 11 and iphone xr design is nice it is litter colour than xr and iphone 11 i face issue that face id is opening by my brother face.it is fixed after reset the face id.,iPhone 12
Great phone. The battery improves after a few cycles,iPhone 12
All things are at its place.. giving it 4 star just because of not giving power adapter with the cell phone. with this huge amount of price we actually deserve a power adapter.,iPhone 12

Perfectness in every inch. Great battery backup and great display. Every thing is perfect. Green colour awesome for light colour lovers. Blue and red are too dark.,iPhone 12
I am using it since two weeks and everything is so good so farI use screen around 6 to 8 hours and still battery lasts for another half day.Tips to over come the heat issue while charging1) close all the apps2)don’t charge after use. Let’s the mobile cool down and then plug in3) follow battery cycle. I only charge when the battery is 5% and plug out after it is full4)use 20 Watts adapter for better battery performance,iPhone 12
"iPhone 12 is the golden mean in all the iPhone 12 seriesBattery lasts for about a day.In Performance section, as usual, Apple is the best.It’s OLED display is mind blowing.Even though it is 5G compatible, 4G also works better.Don’t buy 64 GB as it will choke you much earlier as people tend to use iPhones for long times.",iPhone 12
I bought this product from the showroom but now we shifted from there to a different flat so i can't give the showroom the review. So I am giving it here to help other customers decide. This phone is really awesome! Good job apple. Its better than how I had expected it! Awesome product totally recommend to buy it!,iPhone 12

Good but not good as iPhone 12 Pro  nice flagship nice phone feels like holding iPhone 4+ iPhone 11 mixed,iPhone 12
"Okay I NEED TO CLEAR a few misconceptions about this phone because i am seeing a lot of negative reviews here which are not true, probably from IOS haters. I have been an android user since 2014 when I got my first phone, after many years i switched to Apple after complaining about their high prices  because i was disappointed with Samsung using Exynos processors for their flagship phones in India which causes heating, and Oneplus throwing one cheap model after another every six months.And trust me guys its amazing. The software is butter smooth, i might never go back to android again.  FIRST OF ALL - who said the battery life is bad? I got my phone at 70 percent charge at 2 pm and after 24 hours it was 20 percent EVEN AFTER I KEPT MY DATA PACK ON THE WHOLE TIME.SECONDLY- why are so many guys reviewing the phone on basis of the charger? everyone knows iphone 12 comes without an adapter. did you people not do your research before buying?THIRD - the 60 Hz thing does not matter at all, flipping screen is  real quick u wont even notice the difference from a 120 Hz in androidand lastly - the AI is so sharp, be it the camera which automatically detects low light or even the face recognition.overall this phone is worth the high price. i will definitely be using it for 4-5 years. a happy customer here",iPhone 12
Just great! Initially heating issue with it but I learnt that it’s due to initial setup process! Now it’s just a monster!,iPhone 12
Awesome photo and video quality.Performance is the top notch.as usual awesome iOS.,iPhone 12
Perfect one because iphone is iphone....,iPhone 12
Good one first time using,iPhone 12
"Great phone no doubt, but for the price given the battery capacity should’ve been 3000mah and above.Pros1. Touch feel is improved and smooth2. Getting a bigger ram is a plus point3. Esim is working fine4. Voice clarity is improved (compared with my iPhone 7)Cons1. Battery life...Note- Upgraded from iPhone 7 Recommend for the people who are using  iPhone 8 and below models.",iPhone 12
Iphone stealing money with gimics and some fools are still paying them without thinking. No earphone no power adapter what a ridiculous move!! No value for money & pride symbol now!!,iPhone 12
this is such a cute phone i love the size and performance is far better than 11 series,iPhone 12 Mini
Awsome product Thanks to Amazon ...placed order in first day and delivery is very fast....Mini but Powerful...,iPhone 12 Mini
"I bought this phone for its size. Wonderfully sized iPhone, very suitable for one handed usage. Very pocketable. But battery life is very less. Moderate usage also wont help you last a day.",iPhone 12 Mini
"The battery is worst of a kind. In today’s scenario when the apps are heavy and consume relatively more battery than 5s, something should have been thought of. Poor show",iPhone 12 Mini
"An awesome phone with impeccable design and specifications. It’s an iPhone man jst get it. Oled screen, amazing cameras , decent battery life and color variants spcly the blue one. Proud owner of iPhone mini",iPhone 12 Mini
Over priced. And without charger too.Not recommended. It is a waste of money. Be logical enough to make a call on this.,iPhone 12 Pro Max
"Impressed! I’ve tested it with iphone11 and other iphones, it’s remarkable. It has unquestionably better video quality and touch sensitivity. The screen is bigger than I thought. I loved the Gold variant. But if u have a 11 max or a X max I wouldn’t suggest for an upgradation. I feel that the next iphone will have way more cooler features so wouldn’t hurt to wait. My previous iphone was 6, so in my case am totally peachy with this phone. Though it has a ceramic glass wouldn’t hurt to buy a screen guard. If u can afford it u can totally go 4 it.",iPhone 12 Pro Max
"This is the best iPhone yes. The Max model gives you the better screen and overall is a camera beast. I would highly recommend this to anyone. Regarding value for money, its sad that we live in a country where Falling Rupee, Import Duty and High GST are the reasons for such high poricing. A rich country like USA pays only $1099 (Rs. 81,500) whereas its priced a whopping Rs. 48,400 more in India. Thats slmost 60% more. Shame!",iPhone 12 Pro Max
"Pros: Great display, battery, cameras, usability, ease of access & a whole lot moreCons: Running out of Kidneys to sell to buy iPhones in India 😓",iPhone 12 Pro Max
Is this phone capable of providing good gaming performance like call of duty mobile. Max graphics smooth gameplay ? ?,iPhone 12 Pro Max
"Just no words, what a beauty. Upgrading from iPhone X, this feels so big and heavy. But do not has much discomfort while using, you will get used to it.Make sure to get a decent Screen guard and clear case just to safeguard this beauty.",iPhone 12 Pro Max
"Had pre booked this iPhone 12 Pro Max. Amazon delivered it promptly within four days of launch. Kudos to thisclightening fast delivery.Now about device, Since I upgraded from 11, I could notice the difference between A13 and A14 speed. Miraculously faster. Performance wise this indeed is a notch up.Build quality is significantly improved. This design which Apple brought back from iPhone 5 series is absolutely lovely!  These two factors give it a classy and stylish look combined with solid and durable finish. The phone does feels premium when one holds it. All the more reasons to go ga-ga about this pretty beast!Phone is indeed pricey but if one can shell these bucks; you should not blink your eye before buying. The upgrade does provide you with enhanced durability, performance and looks!",iPhone 12 Pro Max
"The phone is a beast (except for the price which is really high as usual), can't wait for it to launch!",iPhone 12 Pro Max
"Real beast! Its such a treat! All the wait was worth. Upgraded to pro max from iphone x after 2 years. Things have really changed a lot. Camera quality is awesome, night mode is unbelievably good and the best of all...is battery life. After spending whole day with heavy usage, its still about half. Using it with spigen cover and screen guard. Very happy with this new purchase. Using jio main sim with airtel e sim. Both are working smoothly.",iPhone 12 Pro Max
I fell like the phone is bit expensive then it really should be but it's an Apple what can you say thay always one step ahead from ther competitors in terms of pricing..thay also took the charger this time to making more profit out of it..less carbon footprint my ass...but honestly saying accept the price the phone look nice and also fill good in hand not so heavy as i thought.... Display is nice but not as nice as oneplus flagship models... In terms of performance and camera quality iphone still batter then any other phone that available in the market..,iPhone 12 Pro Max

   Apple’s latest flagship makes useful advances over its predecessor in almost every way. Image quality is very good, autofocus is lightning fast and accurate, detail is high, and colors are generally pleasant. Apple remains a leader in preview performance, so what you see when composing a shot looks a lot like the final result. Dynamic range could be better, but mobile photographers should be pleased overall.This iPhone’s weakest link is its lack of long zoom capability, something we’re seeing more of in flagships from the competition. If reach is paramount to you, then there are other phones that excel in this metric (but none that run iOS).Video performance overall is excellent, just short of the best we’ve seen. Wide dynamic range, good color, low noise, and effective stabilization make this iPhone a good choice for users who prioritize video capabilities.For mobile photographers committed to the iOS ecosystem and ready to part with the hefty purchase price, the iPhone 12 Pro Max shouldn’t disappoint.",iPhone 12 Pro Max
"Great sound , great display and camera. Mind blowing design .... Superb .....loved it ..",iPhone 12 Pro Max
Best!! I am a new user of iphone..,iPhone 12 Pro Max
"The phone is a beast. Slightly overpriced, as always. Please choose colours except gold. Everything else is good. Good camera quality even in low light. Need to test the 4K HDR video recording. Esim is working fine.",iPhone 12 Pro Max
"Well, integration with MacBook Pro. (Apple ecosystem)Highly recommended business phone. (Security and Privacy feature)I am a lifelong Android user, After a thorough review finally decided to go with the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max instead of Note 20 Ultra",iPhone 12 Pro Max
"This is the ‘all we can do’ offering of iPhone from Apple in 2020. The phone runs smooth and fast, as expected. A14 Bionic crushes everything you can throw at it with it keeping apps open in the background with zero issues. The battery lasts all day. The camera is amazing and it’s quite a big improvement coming from an iPhone 7 Plus. The screen is vibrant and the speakers sound like a good quality Bluetooth speaker. The pacific blue color is beautiful as well. Looks like grey in certain lighting. However, since this is the biggest iPhone Apple has ever made, I would recommend holding the phone in person before buying as this phone is huge & some people can find it uncomfortable at 6.7 inches. Many people can get 90% of what this phone offers in the smaller 12 Pro. That being said, if you want the biggest screen, the biggest battery on an iPhone and as long as you know what you’re getting into with the size, and you have the money to spend, would recommend this phone 10/10.",iPhone 12 Pro Max
I have upgraded from iPhone X. There's nothing much you can ask for this phone does it all and its a beast. The screen size slightly felt big for a day or two but I got used to it. Camera on this phone is something which really stands out and also the battery is very good. Easily I get 7 hrs of screen on time. If budget is not a problem it is better to get the pro max than pro variant. Overall its a great upgrade!,iPhone 12 Pro Max
"Go for it, you will never regret , if you have budget to take this.",iPhone 12 Pro Max
Great phone. Got the Pacific Blue during pre order. Its a little big to hold with one hand and heavy.,iPhone 12 Pro Max

"Let’s just be honest for a moment if you are buying a phone worth a lakh or more you will not think twice about buying a charger separately...Also the phone has amazing Camera, the best in class videos the display is just brilliant and the video and picture watching experience is goodAs it comes with stereo speakers the sound is incredible ( had put the phone under water while playing music and still it was loud enough)No doubt in performanceOnly complaint is about battery, as the display is bigger and better than ever before so slight improvement needed therePS: I don’t like to use case or screen guard on the phone but wouldn’t risk on this one as its not scratch proof at all , frankly it got more scratches than my iPhone Se (2nd Gen)Peace out ✌🏻",iPhone 12 Pro Max

"I have been into apple ecosystem since iPhone 4s.Since Apple started to move to larger displays they eventually let go the square design which I was missing a lot and did not hope that It ll ever comeback.The time when I saw they are bringing back the squared flat design I was blown away.I pre-ordered from Amazon as soon as it was available.Thanks to amazon I got the delivery on 14th.As soon as I unboxed it I was like wow.The phone feels ultra premium in hand with stainless steel borders and matte finish back.The display lives upto the standards of Apple.Battery life is at par with last year iPhones,though on paper it has a smaller battery.Coming to the camera samples it is again the best camera in a smartphone curretly.The 10bit HDR video is amazing.They have incorporated sensor shift stabilization which I am yet to test.Some of the pros and cons :Pros :DesignLow light camera shotsHDR VideoBattery lifeA14 5nm bionic chipCons:Price is relatively high compared to other marketsNo Charging adapter(might be a huge letdown for people newly moving to iOS)No high refresh rate displays(Although the display does not feel slow )What I felt :I upgraded from 11 Pro Max.For an average user you ll not find a huge difference in terms of overall usage and experience.The size might not be a fit for everyone since its really huge.I am yet to test the magsafe accessories as these aren't available on Amazon yet.So if some one looking to upgrade from iPhone XS or older ,will be a huge upgrade in terms of camera ,performance,battery life etc.Overall,its actually the best iPhone with the all time fav design WITH AN ULTRA PRO MAX PREMIUM COST :p(I ll add camera samples and edit this review after few months of usage)",iPhone 12 Pro Max

"I have been a long time iphone user, but due to the delay in this year's iphone 12 launch and the innovation shown by Samsung with this phone, I made the jump to the Fold 2 this time. I must say that the premium build, large screen and awesome camera has made it truly worth it. Kudos to Samsung for the competitive pricing as well, was expecting this to be launched at ~1.7-1.8 Lakhs. Wherever I take this phone, this turns heads for sure. The large OLED screen is perfect for watching content and it supports HDR on netflix as well. Overall, an awesome product and am loving it!",Galaxy Z Fold2

First review after using the phone for 2 to 3 hours:Very excited to use the phone and eager how it looks till I get the phone from the time of order.Pros:If you are gamer then you will enjoy the big screen and resolution.Both the Cameras are just awesome ( best in market)Looks and feels premium when you hold it in your handComes with dual battery which last for 2 days for heavy usersPerformance of the phone is expected to be great due to its price and is up to mark till now.Comes with 25w charger and supports wireless charging.Cons:Main problem to buy the phone is its price.. which I feel it's over priced.Feels bit heavier.As I like using slim phones.. felt bit uncomfortable in holding the phone.Nothing much different from other samsung phones.. only the fold is exciting.Overall rating considering the price and specification of the product: 3/5.,Galaxy Z Fold2

Screen damaged within 2 months of purchase and the warranty claim is a gimmick.No point spending so much money on such a ridiculous product.Screen replacement 48k with absolutely no support from Samsung service centre,Galaxy Z Flip
"It is a golden goose for Samsung, but is so fragile to handle. The screen looks like Acrylic, that prones to lots of creases across the screen after repetitive usage. At this price range, one can opt for Note 10 plus, which is way far more better than this. It may have its pros, but is a heart breaker on the long run. If one does not need a S Pen, they can go for a clean S10+ or S20, which are sturdy and durable than the Z Flip. Not only Samsung, basically the disadvantage is with the flip, be it Samsung, hello moto, lenovo or HMD Nokia.",Galaxy Z Flip

As per my view...this phone is pretty cool..the folding system makes it more compatible....after folding it's little thicker...and it is very smooth in performance...camera is not so good ...but it's night mode is awesome and cool...rqm 8 gb sufficient 256 gb sufficient display is best even compared to my iPhone 11 ...good buy,Galaxy Z Flip

"Samsung is the only android smartphone manufacturing company who had taken futuristic steps in smartphone industry. Back in 2014 they first made the edge display phone at that time it didn't become popular. After sometime it became a trend and rest of the companies are still following. So may be this is the future of smartphone display. Frankly, I can not afford this phone but it's not about the price, it's about the innovation which samsung will continue to strive.",Galaxy Z Flip
Best mobile with this price range. I loved the camera quality which have 100x zoom.,Galaxy S20 Ultra
"The phone is great and everything I expected it to be, it does get warm/hot sometimes and I believe it will be fixed in the upcoming updates. I preordered this phone and I was supposed to be able to get the Earbuds at Rs.2000 but I am not able to avail it now. This is frustrating.",Galaxy S20 Ultra
"Great product. Smooth 120Hz display refresh rate. Perfect camera system, with fixed auto focus issue. Large size but good weight distribution. Recommend to buy a spigen case with it to protect this very expensive phone.Screen protector is pre applied.Battery life on exynos chip can be between 5-6 hours screen on time (BT, WiFi, on and connected).",Galaxy S20 Ultra
"So after paying over 21% more than last year's Samsung Galaxy S10 plus, Samsung took the courtesy to sell me a phone which is 20% slower than even a mid range phone! It is pretty evident that their Ultra Flagship phone is even slower than last year's Snapdragon 855. Afterall Samsung phones only make decent paperweights now as practically they are far inferior when compared to better brand phones costing less than half the price. Having only used Samsung S series since the origin of android I think it is now time to venture with better brands. Predictable that Samsung is soon to be obsolete and make the same mistake Nokia did. While Nokia never cheated their customers I'm sure there's more coming to Samsung.",Galaxy S20 Ultra
"I pre-ordered two units of this phone. And canceled both of them after getting to know they have used Exynos in it. They have not clearly mentioned it anywhere. The Exynos is so bad that there is even a petition against the chipset in change org.Cons because of the Exynos processor:-) Underperforming device-) Bad battery life-) Gets heated very quickly.-) Bad image processing hence bad camera (photo) quality-) Bad AI processingAdditional Cons:-) The fingerprint reader is slower than the competition-) They use the Sony IMX image sensor in US market and in house sensors in India and some other countries. Which ends up with bad picture quality.-) Cannot use 120 Hz refresh rate and QHD together (most probably because the battery will not last even for 2-3 hours when both are used together, so they have disabled it completely)Pros:+) Good screen when using the 120 Hz refresh rate. But you will have to reduce resolution to FHD from QHD to use it.",Galaxy S20 Ultra
The indian version of this phone is shipped with the exynos processors. I guess samsung treats us Indians as fools! A question to samsung..why not Snapdragon 865SoC for Indian version also. Where it is way much more performant than the exynos processors. Atleast provide an option to the customer to opt for the SoC.,Galaxy S20 Ultra
Worst phone from samsung.,Galaxy S20 Ultra
"Great Device ,JUST upgraded from Note 10 +Read my review , hope it will help you1. Display ( 5/5 ) - Samsung brand makes one of the greatest displays in the smartphone industry , This is absolutely best .. Quad Hd Amoled Dynamic Display is a treat .... The display size is around 7 which is great who likes big sized phones ( like me )...2 . Sound ( 4.5/5 ) - Better sound and louder than my previous note 10 + ....... You will enjoy the sound quality in games or while watching movies3 . Sensors ( 4.5/5 ) - Face unlock is super fast and fingerprint is also good .....4 . Battery ( 4.5/5 ) - I should say 5000mah battery is superb , If you keep 120 Hz refresh rate on , then 6 HR average screen time you should get ..... But if you use 60 Hz and Quad Hd resolution then 8 - 9 HR screen time on heavy usage and 10 + hrs on normal usage which is goodPerformance ( 4/5 ) : slightly better performance than note 10 + , Overall good performance but Exynos processers are behind Snapdragon , but performance is still very good and 120Hz refresh rate is awesome but consumes a bit battery ( using dark theme and wallpaper is my opinion ) If you need a s-pen then stay away , wait for note 20....Camera ( 4/5 ) : The main highlight of this phone .... Good pics but the auto focus fails sometimes , but will fix this issue soon with updates ..... 100X zoom is fabulous , even though pics are little broken , but good pics . If you like to take high quality pics , then you must look at this phone ( If your budget around 100k )Hope my detailed review helps . Thanks",Galaxy S20 Ultra
AMAZINGLY DESIGN WITH LOVEABLE CAMERA WITH HIGH DETAIL'S,Galaxy S20 Ultra
UPDATED:The phone is good and powerful I was an apple user for last 8 years and was looking for a powerful phone with a good quality camera and screen.Indian version needs some software fixes and hopes it will be released and fixed soon.OLDThis is not about the lockdown or something but there is an error claiming the offer. I should have ordered this from Samsung directly.This is frustrating after buying a phone which costs you a fortune and no one is bothered about how a customer is facing issues with back and forth between Amazon and Samsung.,Galaxy S20 Ultra
"Please those who are going for this phone know that the1) phone get to much heated even when it's in ideal condition.2)  Many app crashes all the time3) The signal catching quality is very bad.

G20+ is almost the same as my previous model 8+. In fact I can hardly make out any difference when I am using G20+,Galaxy S20+
"I just bought it two days back and i want to say that there is no such heating issue now... they have fixed it.. i don't  know the snapdragon variant performance so i can't  compare it with that but believe me it is smoother than any other phone you had... also i am a normal user who watches a lot of videos but doesn't  play games so i can't  say anything about heating while gaming... sometimes it heats a little bit but cools down immediately  and you won't even feel the heating... also the finger print sensor is good you just need to put the full finger you cannot keep it partially.. but i dun find it an issue... it just makes it more secure...Also about the battery it takes approx 1.5 hr to get from 0 to 100 and yes it drains as per the usage and as per the refresh rate and display settings... but there is no phone which will give a really great battery back up with all those settings...But with the display, the camera, speakers, features  everything it is the best...My advise is if you are looking for a high end phone it is better than iphone... so you can completely go for it...",Galaxy S20+
"Got the S20+ during festive sale at Rs 46k. Have used it extensively since then. My observations are:PROS-1) Gorgeous 6.7inch AMOLED display with slight curve.2) Clean Samsung One UI.3) 120Hz Refresh rate works like butter4) Knox Security (If one needs an additional layer of security)5) Camera is a very good. Has 30x digital zoom. 4k recording is great.6) Overall a satisfactory user experience.CONS-1) Battery drains pretty quickly even with most of the flagship features turned off. (Has fast charging though)2) Exynos 990 processor.3) Notification light missing (User experience could have been enhanced)4) On screen Fingerprint sensor not very fast.Opinion- Great phone but has its fair share of cons. Primarily Samsung needs to resolve the battery issues which is utterly disappointing. Its of no use if the flagship features need to be turned off to get the best out of the battery. Also, Exynos chipsets still don't match up with SD and while US and South Korea has SD in them, we are shipped with inferior Exynos chips",Galaxy S20+

"I got this directly from IndusInd-Samsung shop. Cosmic grey 128 GB model, with free accidental damage protection. I thought this was Made in India, but it is made in Vietnam unlike the S9 I have.Pro:1. Amazing UI - Signed up for ONE UI 3 beta, the animations are fluid even on 60 Hz refresh rate.2. Camera is great.3. I haven't faced any heating issues till now.4. Faster processing.5. Usable controls - Most of the controls are in finger's reach with One UI 3.6. Power share is great and works well with S9 and Galaxy buds' case.7. Wireless DEX if you have a Samsung TV.8. I don't see much weight difference between this and S99. AKG earphones have good sound quality compared to earphones bundled with other phones.Contra:1. Battery is disappointing.2. It is hard to find a tempered glass which works with ultrasonic sensor.3. No great stock wallpapers like S9. S9 has amazing infinity themes and set of wallpaper. That is something I feel is missing. Although I have seen several stock wallpapers on sites but somehow only one appears on my phone.In 50K it is a great phone to have.",Galaxy S20+
A flagship device with best in class display and UI but totally destroyed by Exynos processor causing poor battery performance and thermal throttling.I am never going to buy or recommend Samsung until they let go of their processing production  unit and install Snapdragon instead of Exynos.,Galaxy S20+
There is only two problems in this Mobile which makes it not worth of 5 star rating. It's problem is It's battery drains faster and it got heated when it got used for 30mins repeatedly. Which is not good for 4500mah battery.Everything except this is very good quality.Samsung should solve this problem by future updates.,Galaxy S20
"Exynos, really Samsung, all these amazing features and Exynos? I would have got this phone if it had Snapdragon processor. Exynos is absolute worse. Would rather wait for a better one",Galaxy S20
"I have been using this phone for last four days. Overall, an excellent phone with not so great battery life. A few quick impressions:Pros:Display is really nice and bright. Watching videos on the phone (with zoom to fill) along with the stereo audio makes it look immersive. Display supports HDR10 (not HDR10+) and this is confirmed by playing YouTube HDR videos.Coming from 60hz makes a lot of difference using this phoneâs 120hz screen. All types of scrolling are exceedingly smooth.Using the camera for some of the still images I found the main (wide) camera and telephoto camera to be of very good quality. Strangely, the ultra wide camera while having a very wide angle, produced images high on noise and mushy edges in good indoor light.Phone performance all round is excellent although phone does get warm occasionally during normal use.Samsung phones have some nifty features - smart pop up (handy for SMS OTPs), wireless Dex (worked well on my 2016 Samsung TV), Edge panel and so on.Build quality is excellent (being IP68 certified), plastic back still looks good. Too bad, there is no proper case available yet.Cons:Battery life is an area of concern and here the misgivings about Exynos appear to be valid. With my daily routine of a few calls, emails, browsing, videos, WhatsApp (no camera, no games), I saw SOT of close to 4 hours. This is with battery optimized mode, all vibration off, dynamic brightness off but 120hz on.The single OTA update has not made much difference on this front. My familyâs Pixel4a running Android 11 and with a much smaller battery has 6hr SOT, hopefully Samsung will do impactful software improvements in the coming days.",Galaxy S20
"Overall build quality and software experience was good but it has a some serious issue which I have faced1) The phone gets often heated in normal use also, if  I want to do any heavy work or used for gaming it feels very warm in palm.2) Same thing also happen when calling to someone it feels very warm in ear even in short duration call.3) Battery drain faster than expected. I think Samsung either used cheap material for keep price lower or it has some software glitch which is need to be fixed.From last 5 days I have received 2 software update but till none of them address this issues.Otherwise phone build was good and it has good device for purchase if Samsung fixes all this issues.Update:- finally fedup with its heating problem and return device to Amazon.Thanks for amazon customer care for their support due to which I save my 50k bucks",Galaxy S20
Its a horrible phone.Battery issues are terrible and on top of it there is no return. It takes 3 hrs to charge and gives not even half a day backup on heavy usage.I'll be pleased if my review can help any single person not to buy such a product.,Galaxy S20

"This phone was delivered to me on 16-Oct-2020 and still, I am having it in company wrapped condition, today is the 14th day and I am still crazy that finally I bought a Samsung premium offering or say, a member from the top segment.The most amazing part is the software experience ðððððI love Samsung for its exceptional innovation and creativity. Also, the UI UX is appealing and Samsung doesn't copy other's ideas, unlike Chinese brands, rather than Samsung believe to create it's own.I guess it is the software and the premium experience which makes a smartphone feels more premium, more appealing, and makes you forget about your pocket which recently got empty.Well, I became a Samsung fan in 2014, I still remember that year Samsung launched Galaxy Note Edge, the first curved screen phone ðððð, I said how appealing it is, but as being from a middle-class family my dad said it will break more easily ðð well true, but after that, I started keeping an eye on Samsung for its innovations and when will I be able to buy one for me, last year, the most fascinating phone in the world, Galaxy Note 10 got announced I went crazy but couldn't buy as I didn't have enough money, I was depositing money for Note series, but when I saw S20 FE at this price with exact software experience little to compensate on hardware specs. I bought this Samsung Galaxy S20 FE. It should be a 5G phone at this price though.I love the smoothness, that 120Hz is really something.With the camera modes and the zoom capability from an 8MPtelephoto, with 3X optical and 30X hybrid, I was able to watch what's written at 400m distance which was impossible for me to read with naked eyes.The slo-mo and super-slo-mo(960fps), that's too awesome with Samsung's capability to capture the slo-mo when an action triggers in the selected area of the frame.Also, the Pro mode for Photos, and Videos, are damn good, and functionalities like audio recording selection through various types of microphones, like with left mic, right mic, Bluetooth mic, or USB Mic. Perfect for Vloggers, pranksters, and productivity as well. Even the gallery features are damn good.It gives an amazing cinematic experience.However, I faced some issues at first, like I experienced temperature rose pretty quickly even while using UI and doing nothing, I reported this issue on the Samsung Members app, and I am so happy for the quick response from Samsung Admins, Admin responded within 30 mins, suggesting me what to do with proper process description, I followed accordingly and was able to get rid of every issue that I faced. But there is still 1 thing that I think needs to be improved, i.e. front camera is 32 MP, 2P lens good for low light, but the clarity it delivers is not so good, also the telephoto lens is 8MP because it's telephoto, it will be zooming, it needed to be a higher resolution one, at least 12MP.Also, I found no difference when Dolby sound was on and when it was off.The feature from last year, the bass and treble knobs have been disappeared from sound settings.Being a Music lover and a Basshead I want a good bass and trebles.The processor might be Exynos(inferior to Snapdragon at this time), but it is not that bad, it is good for productivity, if not for long gaming sessions, and I guess the overall package is better than buying a Chinese phone and indirectly helping China to buy weapons to target our soldiers, our country.",Galaxy S20

This phone could have been 10% cheaper than the current price. However overall a good package to go for where you get all S20 feature in a phone except a space zoom.

"The screen, looks, color options, dust plus water proof quality, feel and camera performance of the phone may all be premium but Samsung should have rounded off the product by taking care all important factors effecting the long / heavy usage - without the juice of battery performance all the good specifications amounts to wasted efforts. Though on paper the hardware shows the punch - in performance, the slow charging plus quick draining battery is a big let down of this model, further compounded by Slow Charging - charger taking more than 3 hours to charge from 5 to 95 percent.This FE version in the legacy of S20 models on offer is a weaker sibling.",Galaxy S20
"The phone is quite snappy and the 120Hz refresh rate is making a difference in the display quality. Here are the pros and cons of the device:Pros:* Perfect size, not too big not too small!* Bright display, better refresh rate.* Image quality from the camera is good, especially the pro mode is a treat if used properly.*Fast wireless charging capacity.*One UI experience.Cons:*Between 60Hz and 120Hz, there should have been a 90Hz option as well.*The battery drain is noticeable, may just be the Exynos problem. Hoping Samsung will address this area in the forthcoming updates.As an early adapter, I see quite a couple of points in the FE20 experience which are disheartening. It hasn't been 2 months and Samsung has already slashed the price of Fe20 from 44k to 37k. This makes you regret your descision.",Galaxy S20

And most importantly everything at this price ends up in a good Spigen case anyway.Also not having a 120 Hz or 90 Hz display doesn't bother me. Days are already busy wfh and I hardly notice the difference. Also 5G, we don't have that kinda tech here in India.

"Letâs make one thing clear immediately: the Xiaomi Redmi 9 is a phone with flaws, and it has a lot of them. On the other hand, it is one of the most affordable phones available anywhere right now, and it's hard to find a better phone at this price point.The screen is of barely acceptable quality, the camera is disappointing, and the performance is middling at best, and yet, the Redmi 9 counters these with its superb design, good feature set, long battery life, and finally, the biggest ace in its sleeve â the ultra-affordable pricing. Let that sink in â the Redmi 9 starts at less than 9000, This alone offsets all of the flaws that the phone has in store for us. Or does it? Let's look at the the many, many corners that have been cut to achieve this pricingð©Â ðªÂ ð¸Â ð®Â ð¬Â ð³Â Plastic is fantastic, especially on affordable phones, and the Redmi 9 once again proves that. The textured back of the Redmi 9 feels great in the hand and provides excellent grip when used naked, though Iâd still recommend putting a case on. I actually quite like the textured back of the device, which not only helps with the grip, but also adds a certain ""cool"" factor to the device, and no, I have zero issues with the fact that I'm touching plastic. Whatâs more, plastic keeps the weight below 200 grams, which is admirable for such a large device with its humongous 5,020mAh battery. Donât get me wrong, itâs still a big and heavy phone, but it doesnât strike as such. Overall, the Redmi 9 is a joy to handle, despite its large dimensions.ð©Â ð®Â ð¸Â ðµÂ ð±Â ð¦Â ð¾Â The display of the Redmi 9 is pretty average. Sure, itâs large and spacious with its 6.53-inch diagonal, and the resolution is more than sufficient, but itâs an LCD FHD+ display with bleak colors, low brightness, and disappointing contrast. The display is lackluster, and I didnât enjoy it at all during my time with the phone. You will also have a hard time under bright sunlight, as itâs just not bright enough.ð±ð°ððð´ððThe battery backup, fortunately, is spectacular on the Redmi 9. With the phone's fairly efficient hardware, the large, 5,020mAh battery takes a long while to drain. You can rest assured it will last you for a long time; in my experience, two days of usage were guaranteed. In our custom battery tests, the phone lasted for a combined time of 10 hours and 14 minutes, which is one of the best results we've seen so far in 2020. Charging, however, is pretty slow â the 10W charger included in the box topped up the Redmi 9 in 168 minutes, or 2 hours and 48 minutes. That's slow, but then again, what else did you expect?ð²ð°ð¼ð´ðð°There are three cameras on the Redmi 9: a 13MP main, an 8MP ultra-wide, a 5MP macro camera, and a 2MP depth sensor. You can also shoot at 2X, but don't get fooled, it's merely a digital zoom solution. Thereâs an 8MP selfie camera up front, and video quality tops up at 1080p at 30fps.",Redmi 9
Awesome,Redmi 9
Best buy at this price! The display quality is amazing and I do not have any complaint with the camera too. There is no other phone available at this price which comes with 4GB ram. You should go ahead with this.,Redmi 9

This phone is not value for moneyIts a downgraded phone of earlier phone launched in india.The camera is worst i ever seen in any redmi phone.Battery is ok.The display quality is very bad not hd. Watching videos on YouTube feels like watching 3gp videos.Dot notch display is ok in lookwise but not good in quality.Sometimes 4gb ram feels like 2gb.I am very disappointed by the camera quality of this phone.12 megapixel feels like 2MP camera.Recently i am using redmi note 5 pro. And this phone is just downgraded phone by redmi .you cannot imagine low light photography in this phone.The back plastic body feels like a cheap phone.If you really need a phone there are many options in the market.If you are taking phone for the first and a beginner you can go for redmi 9 prime.,Redmi 9

"It is a just ok kind of phone. Camera is very pathetic. I did not expect this type of camera in this phone. Even my old redmi 4a mobile is better in camera than this. Apart from camera, I could see there is some lag in the screen while moving to different pages though it has 4GB RAM. Better choose some other phone than this. It has no notification light and has a micro USB charging port. No night mode in camera.Update after using it for 20 days: the phone gets lagging all the time no matter what ever the app you use. It is completely waste of money. Do not buy this mobile.",Redmi 9
Best mobile under 10000 ððð,Redmi 9
Worst product ever as the camera quality is very poort rear as well as front. Amazon was not ready to take the return as they have a new policy now which is replacement policy so they will get you a replacement but won't take it back. Bought that in sale as had heard from friends that redmi phones are good but it ain't. Will suggest not to buy at all from Amazon as it's better to go and buy from the store atleast they take 500rs and will exchange the product. Speaker is poor you can not hear properly on speaker at all. Product is not worth in this price range as one can get better options by payin 1000-2000 bucks extra.,Redmi 9

Both 13 MP and 5MP Camera quality is good. Have lot of pre installed apps. But can be uninstalled if not required. Overall good performance . I am using Asus zenfone max and according to me far better than Asus except Camera quality. It comes in 5000 mah battery and one can't get a better option at this price range. Go for it. It's really goodAfter one week useEdit:- please don't buy this phone. It hangs a lot and sometimes there is problem in touch screen.,Redmi 9A
Camera quality is not good. It is mentioned as 13mp but the motion of the camera is like 2mp. Phone is very slow in operation even though it is 3gb RAM . More over it is MADE IN CHINA.,Redmi 9A
If you are looking for low budget phone this can be a good choice for you.If you wanna android phone just for day to day work then it's really good.On playing heavy games it will hange obviously. Camera is fine at this range. When you start your new device it take some time but later it will work smoothly.Phone is light weight with a good look,Redmi 9A
"Excellent mobile for daily use @7500/-. Don't belive in negative reviews at all. If course the product parts made in China, entire assembly, software all are of India. Even this mobile have no bloat ware or Chinese apps and it's 3gb variant is excellent and black colour looks great.Camera is good at it's price range and has autofocus and AI potrait feature.Regarding battery is really huge and with normal daily usage it lasts for about 24 hrs as of my experience. With heavy usage and gaming it lasts for 7-10 hrs.Regarding gaming, since it has gaming processor helio G25 (equal to Snapdragon 625), and it's hyperdrive technology, no lag in gaming and better network connectivity makes games more aweful.Overall product is excellent at it's price range.",Redmi 9A

I hope you will find it helpful.:)Firstly, Redmi did a great job by introducing cheapest phones with trying to incorporate the features of mid range phones.  5â­ for thatPros-â¢Low price, wont get any other phones in this rangeâ¢ Sleek design, handy phone which will easily fit in your hands and gives you a comfortable feel.â¢Good for basic usage.â¢Nice processing speed with sufficient storage for a basic use phoneCons:â¢camera is not so good dont expect your pictures to be like other phones of 12-15k range. Its an OKAY camera. I feel Could have done better for camera :)â¢Dont support fast charging.

"I am never going to buy any electronic product from amazon anymore. Experienced worst customer service. Product is not upto the mark. Over heating, network connectivity issue was there. They were using their aaps to dignose in which everything will be showing normal. The same aap can not be used in any other phones for checking. That means this aap is specifically designed by amazone for amazon bought mobiles. You will never know if this is correct or not. Based upon that refund/ replancement will not be done.

"With Airtel Sim, neither VoLte and VoWifi are working in my phone. Airtel Thanks app is showing your handset is 4G but not VoLte compatible. Same thing in Vodafone. Is anyone else having this issue? Asked for replacement. Let's see what amazon do with this issue!Update: After my complaint, Amazon replaced my phone with a brand new piece. But the same issue happened with it also. So again I complained and I am so thankful to Amazon that they took my phone back and told me that they will refund my money. Phone was taken back, just waiting for my refund now.If you have a Jio sim, just go for it.

"Overall mobile is good for an average usage. Its camera, audio quality is average to good. Its performance is very good because of good internal storage.Handy as well as the screen is quite wide and provides good viewing angle.Plus point is its battery which is quite huge. Has microusb slot and charger is of 10W thats why charging might be somewhat slow (not that fast)If you want the mobile for an average usage then this can be a best deal for you.I got this 2gb Ram 32gb Rom varient in 6800 Rs.Or if your usage is high i would recommend to go for some other Redmi products for price beyond 8000 to 9000.Below 7000 this product gives satisfactory performance.",Redmi 9A

"This is the most pathetic product that I have ever had the misfortune to buy on Amazon - and you cannot return the product and hope to exchange it for something else because they do not permit ""RETURNS"" only ""REPLACEMENT""  - WITH THE SAME GODFORESAKEN PHONE!!!!!""It comes preloaded with MIUI and other inefficient memory, bandwidth  and battery draining bloatware and constant advertisements all over the place  - and there is no way you can disable them - by buying this phone you are compromising your data and security and paying for an advertiser to constantly bombard you with adverts for thoroughly useless products -  and you have to pay for the bandwidth he uses up.In an attempt to get rid of MIUI you cannot even flash a custom ROM like LineageOS or some of the other AltROMs cause the manufacturers of the device will not share the code. SO IF YOU'VE BOUGHT THIS DEVICE YOU ARE STUCK.Do not buy - if you happen to have paid for it then your fate is sealed - you cannot hope for a refund ---- better to spend that money on buying some cow dung - might help make a cow happy!",Redmi 9A

"Ordered Redmi 9A 3GB 32GB version, sky blue for my mother 2 days ago. Delivery was quick. The delivery guy also opened the package on request for assurance. Got the product as ordered.Initial impressions:Pros:Large screen, Nice color, good processor, ample RAM for daily normal user, good battery backup, drains very gradually even if you are on calls whole day. Removable stock apps, so no need to bother about forced updates for them. Back cover gives you a grip so it won't slip. Display is overall good.Cons:The phone weight is on the heavy side, due to large battery.Camera is not good in low light conditions. (Very good in daylight or external use.)One of the best phones available in the market at this price. I have given it 5 star for specifications in this price range. I ordered it with an offer.. More than what you can get from any other Indian brand in 7000 rs.",Redmi 9A
"This phone is helpful in basic things, camera quality is not good at all, specially rear camera is not good it is really a 8mp camera but Redmi is saying it 12 or 13 MP...making fool to customers.

Battery is actually 4800 mAh..",Redmi 9A

The camera provided in the phone is not  13mp at all.Picture quality is not good and it does not reflect the true colors.its ok that it is a cheap phone but atleast they should mention the correct configuration. If you compare camera picture quality with nokia phones I must say that 2mp camera in nokia made phones have better picture quality that 13mp of this phone. Its OK that this is vewry cheap phone but customer should not think that they will get a 13mp camera. Samsung or nokia make phones with 8mp camera might have better picture quality.rest i can write once i use this phone for a month.,Redmi 9A

"I bought this phone on the amazon prime sale. It was a great deal will a of discounts and I was able to buy it for under â¹9,000. I've been using this phone for almost a month now and here are my feedbacks.Firstly the good points. Very sleek, good screen size and the menus are user friendly. It has face unlock, pattern and pin unlock as well but no biometric. I can't be asking for more features for this price. 2 sim trays and one SD card tray which is great. I had been using both sim trays form this phone.Now for the bad points. I'm not able to set 2 different ring tones for each sim. So when a call comes in you can only tell by looking at the screen showing on which sim I am getting the call. Next, Screen brightness is not that great. On a bright sunny day, its sometimes not bright enough even if you turn brightness to the highest. Hotspot works fine but you cannot see how many devices are connected. Moreover, you also cannot see which device is connected. Then there are those unwanted, useless Mi apps that comes standard in the phones that send you notifications to upgrade and install even though those apps have not been updated by me.These are the major points. Apart from this, there seems to be no other issues. For a secondary phone this phone is great. Value for money.",Redmi 9A
"Good product for budget price rangeBut camera quality is average otherwise, value for money  product",Redmi 9A
"Amazing phone in such a low price.Great don't hesitate to buy if it doesn't have a fingerprint sensor because it has a very quick face recognition, don't hesitate to buy if it doesn't have dual Or tripple cameras because its single camera beats most of the dual and triple camera phones, don't hesitate to buy if it doesn't have a fingerprint sensor because it has a very quick and last thing don't think like its cheap so obviously it will have poor looks and downgraded, no in this phone this isn't the case. Overall I'll give full stars and attaching some samples which have been slightly edited with In built editor..",Redmi 9A

"We haven't seen the âPrime' branding on a Redmi smartphone in a really long time, but now Xiaomi has brought it back with the Redmi 9 Prime. Xiaomi explains that this model has been launched because its Redmi Note 9 series has become more expensive due to the GST hike and Rupee-Dollar fluctuations. The Redmi 9 Prime is priced below the Redmi Note 9 series and starts just below the Rs. 10,000 price point. Has Xiaomi gone overboard with cost-cutting, or does the Redmi 9 Prime offer you good value for money? I review the new Redmi 9 Prime to find out.At the beginning of our Redmi 9 Prime review, we stated that the smartphone is a prime contender for the best smartphone under Rs 10,000 currently in India. Redmi 9 Prime is a budget all-rounder that ticks most boxes right with its value-for-money performance package.The camera unit may not be the best but it gets the job done. The lack of night mode is a bummer though. You can pick Xiaomiâs own Redmi Note 9 (review) that gets points for its big battery, decent display and an above-average performance unitI bought it for youtube review but it changed me",Redmi 9 Prime

Good but camera quality not good,Redmi 9 Prime
This phone is unnecessary creating black market ...By launching the phn in flash sale 90% phone are booked by bookies and sell in open market for Rs1000-2000 extra cost. I stopped using Redmi everyone should also do so.,Redmi 9 Prime
"At A price Point of 12000 this is definitely not a best phone because In Box Only 10W Normal charger is available2- At 12000 , How a 13 MP CAMERA IS worth?Narzo Is a better deal than this at 12000rs",Redmi 9 Prime

"Hi Guys  I write this review to encourage you to buy this Powerful Processor Smartphone with easily enough 5020Mah Battery with Full HD Plus Display, proves that it is one and only Real Value of Money Budget Smartphone of Covid19 infected year 2020. Must buy it before MI increases its price from Rs 9999 to Rs 10999.However, I'll recommend everyone to buy a 4GB Ram 64GB Variant as one has to pay Rs 2000 more for increasing only 64GB Storage to 128GB Storge and for Rs 11999 we have available Realme Nazro 10 with more Powerful Quad Camera along with 18W Fast Charger for which one has to Spnd more Rs 600 more to purchase separately for RedMi Prime Customer! Same difference also in Rear Camera also as Realme provides 16MP while RedMi 9 Prime only 8MP! It must be mentioned here that Camera Quality of RedMi 9 Prime is worth of Money if you buy 64GB Variant!In short, I'll recommend to everyone to buy this Smartphone before it's price hike as after increasing GST to 18% it has become just a Dream to buy a Smartphone with Powerful Battery back up, Powwrful Processor HelioP80, Quad Camera and Full HD Display!Thanks for reading my review!",Redmi 9 Prime

"By good luck, I was able to get this phone in the third flash sale. Earlier i had participated in two flash sale but the phone was going out of stock in a few seconds. I am very happy with this phone. it is performing very well. no other company are providing great specifiation in this price segment as this phone has. this phone has media tek helio G 80 processor, full hd plus display, quad camera setup along with 13 mp primary camera and 8 mp selfie camera. phone comes with 5020 mah battery with 18 watt type c fast charging support.however in box you will get 10 watt charger but you can buy quick charge 3.0 (18watt) charger on mi store in only 500rs.  but there is one issue for those customer who are interested to buy this phone is that, black marketing is going on. offline seller buy this phone by the help of their group network on telegram and whatsapp by giving some money to console and sell it by overprice. thus the customer who truly need this phone are returning disappointed. i think COD option should be disable to stop black marketing.",Redmi 9 Prime

Disgusting. Ratings are only 52 after 3 flash sales, that itself tells the story.If the stock went out just after it started and ratings are only 52, what sale is it making, keeping 10 units for each flash sale?There is no news on how many sales are made in each flash sale, that speaks for itself.",Redmi 9 Prime

Redmi 9 Prime is a Scam I'll try all sales but I don't buy it just 12 o'clock this sale was all claimed no option for buy or add to cart it's a Scam,Redmi 9 Prime
"No doubt....Redmi 9 Prime is the most budget friendly handset...you get decent quality specs, type-c port and a 1080p display just for 10k !! Everything's good....no need to talk about every sepc one by one separately. Except the only downside being camera...but that is acceptable....you cant get high quality sensors for 10k. Not much bloatwares...no banned apps...no adds...almost clean ui experience...no heating issue.For me, It beats any of its competitors like Narzo 10, 10a, C3 and other similars.  Dont waste money on  downgrade phones like Redmi 9, 9a etc. Now if you compare it with recently launched narzo 20a in this price, yes narzo has better battery but remember it doesnt have FHD display, so you wont get quality video and graphics intense gaming experience and there is not very huge difference between 12mp and 48mp camera, So make choice between better battery or better multimedia.The only reason I have given one star less is because of the price. The price of 64gb variant is abolutely amazing but not for 128gb one and I am reviewing for latter. For 128gb variant, either there should have been more 2gb of ram with a fast charger or the price should have been 11k. Xiomi is charging extra 2k just for extra 64gb storage, totally dishonest.Tip : Using a lite UI like Evie launcher and lite keyboard can help free some amount of ram and extend battery backup.Thank You",Redmi 9 Prime

"The phone (4/128) which is effectively priced at 9999/- (with 1000/- inclusive) amazon cashback didn't even came near its competitor brothers. The camera deserves the least rating, dont go with the number of rear camera pinholes.Primary camera is only 13 mp. Even my earlier Redmi 3s prime shoot better picture.  Coming on to the delivery side, I ordered a trouser along with the phone. So amazon saved the environment for the sake of my 10k. They packed it together and sent it to me with paper tapes. I know they wil tell it is tamper guaranteed packing or eco friendly but still, they should bubble wrap it and atleast make it secure.  Then coming onto the battery, the backup is good but the charging time it takes is around ""2 hour 30 mins""(0% -100' %). Whereas if you invest 3k more you get 33W chargeable phone.  The alternatives present for this phone is immense if you could stretch your budget by 2 or 3 k.  I got a black back cover, transparent, more clearly translucent.  Then to the pros of phone, it is fast, FHD+, screen size is comfortable.I am sticking onto this phone only because I can't return it only replace it.My ratings.Amazon Packing 1/5Camera 0/5Battery 4/5Charging time 2/5Screen 4/5Response and performance 4/5So in my verdict, do thorough research in the internet ,your techie friends or youtube before going for a final decision . My budget I  limited to this much and we all go for a gadget update every 2 year minimum. I am satisfied with the product for my general office usage .",Redmi 9 Prime

Additional plus - Gorilla glass, wifi calling, finger print censor.7. I bought this mobile with below offer,Redmi 9 Prime (4GB RAM, 128GB Storage) -MRP- 13,999 ( selling price 10,999)---------------------------------------------+++Exchange - 3000Rs.+++Amazon  - 1000 instant cash back.+++Bank offer - 800 instant cash back.###############################Finally, I Purchased this mobile for Rs. 6199.With no doubt - This mobile nailed all other brands in the same/similar segment.To be noted (Cons)1. Camera (not up to the mark) - my rating 5/10.2. Though it's a fast Charging, however it takes more time with the charger they provide which is 10v. ( Suggest to buy 20v charger seperately which will definitely help).3.This is not a Snapdragon processor mobile. But this MediaTek Helio G80 chipset for the Redmi 9 Prime makes the Prime one of the most powerful phones in its class. ... The Helio G80 is a decent chip to play games on and the Redmi 9 Prime shows that with pride.//*****************************************//If you look for performance, Ram, hardisk, display size,full hd, battery - You can definitely go with this mobile.Incase if you are fond of taking pics (camera) - definitely Dnt go for this mobile.The option is yours .........",Redmi 9 Prime

First time when i tried i missed the deal and couldn't plaxe order.. But second time i prepared for some tricks and tips and tried. It helped me lot and i ordered my mobile..

I am writing this review after using this phone for a week. And believe me this is a fabulous phone under 10K. I am highly impressed with its battery backup. You get a 15W charger with it. You charge it once till 100% and it will give you a backup of at least 1 day. The performance is also impressive and powerful. If you have a tight budget like me I would highly recommend you this phone.One of the best of Xiaomi.Thanks Amazon and Xiaomi.......,Redmi 9 Prime
"I bought this phone for mu daughter, but when configure this phone with my daughter account(which is a google children's account and blocked some apps like MI theme) the phone doesn't even boot, finally i had hard format it, and configure it with my account it start working.But, my whole purpose of buying this phone is defeated as i can't use my children's account on this and control her activities.EVEN WORST IS THE NO RETURN POLICY, THAT MEANS YOU CAN'T RETURN IS ONLY REPLACE IT, MEANS YOU WILL GET THE SAME PHONE BACK EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT SATISFIED WITH THE PHONE",Redmi 9 Prime

"My Mobile phone has some screen issue. On completely black wall paper or black background there's a permanent white dot (like screen is defective) on the screen but i requested for the replacement soon device will be replaced. Although device is preety average, ram management is not that good.go for the snapdragon rather than mediatek.Pubg lags sometimes on medium settings and there's a ton of preloaded apps from which some apps you cannot uninstall.there are several options in the market other than xiaomi. So,choose your device wisely.",Redmi Note 9
"Hi I am writing this review post usage of 7 days,1. The Dsiplay is perfect better than Samsung M21 in the similar price range. The display is Full HD+ whereas its counter parts are not offering that.2. The camera scores over its counter parts whereas not much variations available in Selfie but fantastic at this price.3. The specifications are more or less similar to Mi Note 8 except the processor, it's Helios G85 in this one whereas its Qualcomm in Note 8 i.e 625.4. Note 8 had 4K video capture option but not with the latest  Note 9.5. The battery stays long as promised as I am not a gamer the battery lasts for over a day and half.6. This had P2i protection towards splash but not with Note 8.7. To conclude I shall recommend this phone as no brands available at such good price.Thanks for reading god bless . Enjoy",Redmi Note 9

"Hi all,As I have bought redmi note 9 pro on first sale, I would like to share my review on this.I would give  you my honest experience..I will talk only about the Lacunas/cons  of this phone,1.Battery-it lasts only for 24 hrs by general use,(like phone call, YouTube, whatsup video call) without gaming, while gaming it's battery drains fastly, for charging it takes 2 hrs.2.Camera-As it is 48 MP, I personally did not find anything like 48 MP, rather samsung M30 has better quality of pics than this 48 MP, Night mode is not good enough,Its just a hipe,clarity has to be compromised,Even front camera is not good, pics get blurr by zoom. Same here samsung M30 again have gain..So camera is not as good as they told., blur and shaggy images, I have really disappointed.3.Display- kindly go for super Amoled display, if you compare FHD of redmi note 9 pro and sAmoled of samsung you will really feel the difference,4.Gaming has heating problem,battery drains fastly,5.weight is something I feel heavy, hard to use by single hand.6.sound is average,So it's my honest feedback after using it for 4 days. I really feel disappointed.( In battery, camera, display, Sound)Now other things like processor, interface,speed, design, finger print sensor are best.Thanks ð",Redmi Note 9 Pro

"Super camera, battery, sound amazing  very much",Redmi Note 9 Pro
"Got the Note 9 Pro in Galcier White Colour on first sale itself. I skipped Note 8 Pro. Swift Delivery with Amazon. After spending a few weeks with it, here's my experience. I keep switching phones often and let's see if Note 9 Pro is the ideal phone.Design:Awesome design. I like the center placed punch hole camera, it gives a overall sense of symmetry. The Aura Balanced Design is premium. Glass Front & Back With Curved Edges. Plastic Frame. Phone comes with a silicon back cover in the box and a plastic screen guard pre applied on the screen. Looks really nice with the white colour but due to 20:9 aspect ratio and large screen, it is a tall phone, quite difficult to handle single handedly even with my big enough hands. Also I now need to buy jeans with bigger pockets because in my wardrobe I couldn't find a jeans that could accommodate this phone comfortably. Although It is a nice premium looking design but not practical due to being tall which hinders one handed usage. Also the camera bump is protruding a few millimetres but Xiaomi claims that the Camera module is also coated with Gorilla Glass 5 Protection so it should be scratch resistant to some extent.Display:Screen being an IPS LCD Full HD+ Panel is large at 6.67 inches with 20:9 aspect ratio, is tall and not too wide. Bezels around are very slim and the chin is minimal. Screen to body ratio is impressive. It's certainly big or tall in vertical terms. Quality wise the screen is good, brightness is satisfactory for indoor and outdoor usage but the screen is not as vivid or lively as AMOLED screens. Viewing angles are good. Little bit colourshifting can be noticed when viewing from different angles. No higher refresh rate though which everyone kinda expected. Touch response is good, not too fast or too slow even when playing PUBG. Brightness could've been more for better outdoor visibility under direct sunlight. Reading mode is there to filter harmful bluelight. Overall, display quality is good and satisfactory.Sound Output:Sound quality is clear and loud through the speaker, thought lacking on bass and instruments. Call quality is loud and clear as well. Earphone output is little disappointing. I have premium sounding earphones which sounded better on my previous phone but the sound output via the 3.5mm jack is quite low on the Redmi Note 9 Pro so you've to crank up the volume and let's not talk about the richness of the sound which is completely lacking. While playing PUBG Mobile with Earphone plugged in, I could barely hear the footsteps in the game and had to crank up the volume to max. Everyone should report this earphone sound quality issue to Xiaomi. Update: Low Volume Level in earphones has been fixed after OTA update but the richness in audio is still lacking.Performance:Performance is fine even on the 4 GB 64 GB Variant. Didn't see any lag or shutter while performing normal day to day tasks, thanks to Snapdragon 720G Chipset built on a power efficient 8nm Process. Now the big question, can it handle PUBG?Yes, you can play PUBG Mobile with Smooth & Ultra (40 fps) Combination and HD & High Maximum but the game is not properly optimized as it is a new chipset. I played PUBG for 2 straight weeks on Smooth and Ultra Graphic settings and noticed the game freezing in classic and other modes for a few seconds in almost every match.. Earlier I used to play PUBG in Smooth & Extreme (60fps) option on my previous phone so playing in Ultra (40fps) on Note 9 Pro feels little downgrade. Gameplay was smooth for most of the part but frame freezes quite frequently which made the gameplay not so enjoyable. Didn't notice any heating issues. Temp was mostly under control. Another problem I encountered with PUBG is the low sound output from the earphone (Ant Audio W56 or any other) plugged in. Xiaomi should rectify this issue ASAP!Update: Low Volume Level in earphones has been fixed after OTA update.Cameras:Talking about the camera quality, I am not impressed with the Note 9 Pro. The quality is average, default 12 MP shots from the main camera lack details when zoomed in and look oversharpened along with a warm colour tone and noise and other post processing artefacts quite visible even in good lighting conditions. HDR is a hit or miss most of the time. There's a new option in the camera app to boost colours similar to Chroma Boost feature found in Realme Smartphones. 48 MP shots look a little better especially in terms of details in comparison to default 12 MP Shots. Front camera quality is average as well. To be honest, I'm little disappointed with the camera output but it's not a major issue as I have a Nokia 808 PureView as my go to Camera Phone since 2014. You could install GCam Mod for better quality output as Camera 2 API is supported out of the box.Connectivity:Had no issues with WiFi or Bluetooth. It has support for NavIC, India's own satelite for navigation. No issues with location services.Though didn't notice a faster location locking using NavIC. Cellularr Network Strength I found is little low in my experience, because the same SIM Cards inserted in my other phone used to provide better network reception, as a result, the download speeds are somewhat lower on Note 9 Pro. Will test further and update here.Battery is rated at 5020 mAh and Xiaomi is providing 18W Charger in the box. If we remember a year ago, 18W was considered fast but this time it has a larger capacity battery than previous Note series smartphones. A full charge normally takes more than 2 hours which is not bad for a 5000 mAh battery. Everyone this time expected Xiaomi to provide a charger rated at 22W or more. The global variant ships with a 22W Charger. Why Xiaomi? Battery can get you more than a day depending on your usage so it shouldn't be a problem. It's good for long gaming sessions as well.Some really important features worth mentioning:It has 2 SIM Card Slots with a dedicated MicroSD Slot so it's a good decision on part of Redmi/Xiaomi. The charging port is Type C which I appreciate. Fingerprint Sensor is mounted on the Side Power Button and it's fast to unlock the phone. You have the option to choose whether to press the power button or just touch on it to unlock the phone. IR Blaster is another nifty feature to control various electronic appliances. It works well with my Set Top Box so no need of reaching the remote everytime I want to switch channels or lower the volume. Fortunately there is a notification LED next to the earpiece, though you only get a single white colour. Still I consider the notification LED as an essential feature.OS:It's running MIUI 11 on top of Android 10. I liked MIUI during Redmi Note 3 times when it was a clean UI and had no Ads or content recommendations feature inbuilt. Still It's packed with features and offers a lot of customization though the amount of bloatware is ridiculous. Thankfully almost all of them can be uninstalled which I recommend. Content recommendations and ads can be partially turned off. Just don't like that there's no option to uninstall the Mi Browser.So to sum it up, I would say it's a good phone for the price except for a few things.Pros:Premium Design.CGG 5 Protection Both Sides.Nice Display Quality.Good Sound Via Loudspeaker.IR Blaster.Good Performance.Less Heating.Very Good Battery Backup.Cons:Quite Tall So One Handed Usage Is An Issue.Protruding Camera Module.No 90 Hz Refresh Rate.Average CamerasPUBG Mobile Not OptimizedNetwork Reception & Download Speeds Should Be Improved.",Redmi Note 9 Pro

"Bought Redmi Note 9 Pro (Interstellar Black) in 1st sale, using it extensively. Read my review, if you are planning to buy one.EDIT: 1. Updating review for using more than a month, facing some strange battery drain issue, battery is not lasting even for a day. Once, fully charged, it automatically gets decreased by 5-10% without doing anything.2. For daily usage screen size feels too big, not easily manageable, also device is bulky.--------------------------------Pros:1.  48MP Quad Camera (with Samsung GM2 Sensor) captures amazing pictures, both outdoor as well as indoor.- Even in low light conditions, photo looks cool.- Selfie looks more natural, not over beautification like oppo,vivo.2.  6.67 inch FHD+ dot display looks good.3.  Dedicated Memory card slot.4.  5020 mAH li-polymer battery - it easily lasts for more than a day with average usage.- With 18w charger, it takes less than 2 hrs for full charge.5.  P2i splash-proof nano-coating6.  Notification LED7.  IR Blaster*NavIC for navigation, but haven't noticed any difference than GPS.Cons:1.  60 Hz display (vs 90 Hz display of Realme 6) : Difference is noticable, while playing games.2.  For PUBG, RN9Pro frame rate setting limited to Ultra, on other hand, Realme6 supports up to Extreme.In short, Gaming is better on Realme 6 with MediaTek G90T.Final Verdict: If you want device with better battery performance, Redmi Note 9 Pro is gold choice.- For better display & gaming experience, get Realme 6.*Will edit review, after using few more days.",Redmi Note 9 Pro

They are advertising top gaming GPU, but the games like COD PUBG loads slower than Redmi note 83. Takes very long for full charge, 4-5 hours4. I have faced glitches while playing games, like sound stops or decreases on its own5. Camera stops and needs phone restartSo i would suggest to buy some other phone as it is not good for gaming",Redmi Note 9 Pro
Awesome phone with nominal rate.Pros: 1. Good features and battery.2. Good for gaming(pubg)3. Android 10 is smooth.4. Fingerprint is located in comfort position. Fingerprint sensor response is really good.5. Huge display.Cons:1.bloatware apps.2. Battery lightly heats up when charging. (Quick charge 18w is reason I guess) if you remove backcase. Then it may cool down.3. Bit heavy 208 g. (While playing game I can feel it)If you manage cons then it's really premium phone to buy.I was iphone6s user. When I thought it won't match to iphone. But the phone doesn't disappoint me. I really happy with my purchase. It is also come with pre applied screen protector and transparent case. I never liked redmi UI earlier. Now Xiaomi really improved all features. Phone looks premium model. About performance it's not at all lagging.I bought 6 gb ram and 128 gb internal variant.Overall its worth every penny.Go for it.,Redmi Note 9 Pro
"This phone promises lot but gives very less.Most Importantly 48mp option in camera modes.I didn't find much difference in normal mode and 48mp mode. Sometimes photos taken by 48mp are noisy, 48mp mode doesn't work well when strong ambient light present.Other issue is Google assistant. I tried many times to wake assistant with command Ok google, but it doesn't work only. I've set up everything in assistant which is essential to use voice assistance, but no usePlease don't feel heart broken, so far these two are the only drawbacks I found but I must say battery is just wow. With one full charge phone last almost 2 days with normal use. I was surprised. Camera also works well for 13k mobile. Except 48mp mode, maybe due to some software issues. Otherwise phones runs quite smoothly, load games & apps very quickly",Redmi Note 9 Pro

"performance is very bad.. even when I opted for 6gb ram.lags, stucks many times.. annoying.camera is good and battery is fine",Redmi Note 9 Pro
"Please don't buy it.It's not a quality mobile, it just like Redmi Note 4.  No special features added in Redmi Note 9 Pro Max which can be differentiate with Note 4.  Battery is not so good, it doesn't retain power long time.  Other company's mobile are giving some special technology like Samsung M31 (6000 mah battery, Amoled Screen, sony camera lense and so many features) in lesser price.  It is not a value for money, not a good product.  Why the company has fixed so high price? The answer I would like to know from company.  After purchasing it feel nothing worthy with the set because I am still using Redmi note 4. Just looting with custom in the Covid 19 pandemic situation.  No discount isoffered in credit card nor no cost EMI nor Exchange in flash sale.  In the name of flash sale seller makes fool to us. This is my personal experience and opinion.  If any body hurts, I feel sorry, but I revealed the truth.You can get far better mobile with this price of â¹18, 500. Its a cheating with the customer because price is high but no quality improvement in comparison with Redmi Note 4.  I feel better Redmi note 4 with lesser price than 9 Pro Max.",Redmi Note 9 Pro Max
Actually asusual best phone by redmi.Amazing phone design with best quality camera. Very excellent built quality. It comes with 33w fast charging which is really fast.But I wish it would have 90hz refresh rate.,Redmi Note 9 Pro Max
Product performance is poor.Its speed is like 2 GB RAM mobile.Processor is too slow feels like very old mobiles.Battery drains very fast.Worst mobile performance.Not even like Redmi Note 4.Waste of money. 17000 is too much price for such poor performance.I think worst product from Xiaomi RedMi.Samsung M31 is far better in performance and battery.,Redmi Note 9 Pro Max

"Awsome product. I had my doubts buying another Redmi device after my mom bought one for herself 1 year ago. It got the annoying ads problem. But so far I'm yet to see my first ad. You have to be careful the first time you switch on the phone out of the box and untick all the personalization stuffs. Same goes for the first time opening any apps after booting. If then, u'll probably never see any ads like me. The battery is what they promised and it holds up to more than 1and half days for moderate usage. And the fast charger is pretty cool. 1 hour from 0 to 100%. It has Navic which is really accurate(tested it with GPS). It's really big but its right for me since my hands are big too. But probably for lots of people they'll have to always use both their hands for operating the phone, my mom finds it pretty hard to use. So, my honest review is, in 2020 this is an awesome choice and great value for money if you have big hands.",Redmi Note 9 Pro Max
"Not satisfied with productSince we use redmi mobile brand in my family even base varaint sounds good performance after 2years when am using this for first time. Dis appointment on purchasing this.I tired to record voice from this mobile around 1pm and sound was good. I thought wow such a nice but after 30min .

"I purchased Redmi note 9 pro max on 07-Aug-2020 and it is delivered to me on 08-Aug-2020. Delivery and package wise no issues. It is in brand new condition, the seal didn't tamper. I started restoring the apps and contents from the old phone - Redmi Note 4.  After loading some applications, Note 9 pro max mobile started producing excessive heat which I couldn't expect from 8GB RAM. Sound clarity is average, bearly hear sound from videos/music from YOUTUBE/ Facebook.  Really disappointed with phone because of these two issues. Rest all OK.",Redmi Note 9 Pro Max

Excellent performance..after using 2 days I found that the quality of Redmi note 9 pro max is superb but there are some pros and cons..And some Dispointing thing also..Pros-6 GB RAM 64 GB ROM ðCamera quality is best for this range but they need to more improvement in Wide angle camera..Battery backup is Very goodProcessor is Very strong side of this phone..If anyone wants for gaming purpose they have to must by this phone.Cons-I ordered Redmi note 9 pro max (INTERSTELLER BLACK) but inside the box colour of the handset is diferent you can view in uploaded pics..2nd The Price range is too high but may be due to high demand..Overall I like this but only Dispointing thing is i received different colour set.,Redmi Note 9 Pro Max

"DespuÃ©s de un mes de uso, estoy totalmente satisfecho con el telÃ©fonoLo recomiendo al 100% si buscas una gran cÃ¡mara y el soporte de Google, con actualizaciones rÃ¡pidas y Android puroPROS- Se acomoda muy bien en la mano y el ensamble es de buena calidad- Botones fÃ¡ciles de alcanzar y con buena sensaciÃ³n al presionarlos- El lector de huellas es bastante rÃ¡pido y preciso- Altavoz estereo con sonido decente- Tiene entrada de 3.5mm para audÃ­fonos- Andoid puro que hace la experiencia de uso bastante limpia y fluida. Viene con la versiÃ³n 10, actualizable a 11- Google garantiza actualizaciones hasta agosto 2023- Tiene una e-sim integrada para habilitar dual sim- Definitivamente la cÃ¡mara (mÃ¡s detalles abajo)- BaterÃ­a no muy grande pero suficiente para el dÃ­a a dÃ­a- Instructivo y adaptador para migrar todos los archivos de tu telÃ©fono viejo de manera sencilla- Pantalla OLED 60HzCONTRAS- El cuerpo es de plÃ¡stico (personalmente no me molesta)- El lector de huellas apenas tiene relieve y puede ser dificil encontrarlo hasta que uno se acostumbra. TambiÃ©n ocasiona toques accidentales- La pantalla no es la mÃ¡s brillosa, carece un poco en ambientes de mucha luz- No tiene dual sim fÃ­sica (se puede habilitar con e-sim)- Aun no hay muchas opciones de fundas pero seguramente se irÃ¡n actualizando- Sin carga inalÃ¡mbrica- Sin reconocimiento facial- Sin ranura para microSD (los 128gb internos para mÃ­ son mÃ¡s que suficientes)CÃMARA- Solo tiene un lente, pero es lo suficientemente bueno para compensar la falta de otros- El obturador es rÃ¡pido- El procesamiento es tardado (5 segundos aprox) pero la calidad que resulta lo compensa- CÃ¡mara lenta de hasta 1/8x- FunciÃ³n de time lapse integrada- El modo de visiÃ³n nocturna es bastante buena- OpciÃ³n de fotos en RAW- Graba video hasta 4k* En las fotos se muestra el modo retrato.

"I finally switched from Samsung and Motorola phones to a Pixel. I had read a lot of websites extolling how good of a price it was based on the features and decided to give it a chance.Overall, I would say that it is worth the money, but, having it for a few days now, there are some obvious pros and cons.Pros:Definitely the price3 years of software support/upgradesNot full of bloatwareCons:The camera takes great pictures, but the software is lacking so every time that you take a picture and want to see it, you need to wait 5 seconds before the phone processes it.There is no wireless charging.There is no facial recognition.The sound was a real letdown. It is not nearly as loud and clear as similarly price phones.The screen is a bit small and the actual body of the phon doesn't seem as solid as I have come to expect from similar phones.I definitely think it's in the above average range based on the amount that you are paying. But, keep these cons in mind and add in that soon Google will be releasing the 5g versions which this one is not.",Pixel 4a

"LlegÃ³ en excelentes condiciones. El telÃ©fono estÃ¡ muy padre, bonito diseÃ±o y la mejor cÃ¡mara que puedes encontrar en celulares de esta gama. La experiencia de usuario es increÃ­ble, una vez que te acostumbras a los gestos no querras regresar a los aburridos clÃ¡sicos botones. El sensor de huellas funciona muy bien. El sonido estereo no serÃ¡ el mejor, pero el simple hecho de ser estereo ya le da un cambio de 360 grados a la experiencia con el audio, nada mal.  Recomiendo comprar un case, ya que por el material y diseÃ±o del telÃ©fono se llega a resbalar si no tienes cuidado.",Pixel 4a
"Excelente telÃ©fono, realmente no se siente gama media y no le pide nada a otros de gama ""premium"".Tiene la mejor pantalla que he visto en toda mi vida, con una nitidez impresionante, un diseÃ±o de policarbonato (plÃ¡stico) que no se siente como tal y tiene un tacto muy agradable, es bonito y creo que las imÃ¡genes que hay en internet no le hacen justicia. El audio es bueno pero me hubiera gustado un poco mÃ¡s de volumen.Una sola cÃ¡mara que hace fotos super nitidas con buenos colores y HDR de impacto que en cualquier condiciÃ³n es sorprendente.

El equipo en mano es fÃ¡cil de manipular, es muy cÃ³modo.En el apartado auditivo, a pesar de tener sonido estÃ©reo no es la mejor calidad que puedes encontrar, le falta volumen y al volumen mÃ¡ximo distorsiona.En cuanto a autonomÃ­a de la baterÃ­a solo les hizo falta agregar mÃ¡s mA, eso porque estoy acostumbrado a los tÃ­picos 4000mA de los gama media.En conclusiÃ³n el equipo es bueno, rinde lo que debe rendir para su gama.",Pixel 4a

Es lo que compre exactamente,Pixel 4a
"This phone was purchased after extensive research and positive first hand experience with the Pixel 3a.  After several weeks of waiting for the new phone to ship after it was released, I am very pleased with the functionality of this new Pixel 4a.One of the biggest selling points for this phone is the price. I didnât want to finance another $800 phone from Verizon so I opted for an unlocked phone that I could purchase and connect to their network. This phone was a bargain at $349, but there is nothing cheap about this phone except for the price.The Good: Besides winning on price, this phone was a breeze to set up. The SIM card easily inserted into the phone and it quickly connected to the Verizon network without issue. The set up instructions were easy to follow to get the phone up and running quickly. The Pixel 4a also transferred all data, apps, and pictures from my old Galaxy S7. It used a USB cable to connect and download everything. Even texts, voicemails, and everything else transferred over so I never felt lost. Google Chrome and Gmail are my primary browser and email so browsing history and saved passwords also transferred over.  Apps needed to be logged into again and there were some forgotten password issues, but nothing that couldn't be fixed.Once connected this phone operates smoothly and it is easy to navigate. It is a bit different than th 3a and other Android phone as there is no back button and everything is controlled through swipes.  It takes some getting used to but works smoothly once you get it down. The camera is outstanding and surpasses any phone previously used.  Another bonus with this phone is the battery life which ranks high on my list of important features. This battery lasts all day long even with regular use.  The battery on the 3a is great and the battery on the 4a is awesome!  It also charges very quickly with the provided charger and I estimate a full charge takes approximately one hour.The Bad: The bad really isnât all that bad when taken in proper context. There is a reason this phone is half the price of other models since itâs missing some luxury features. Apparently this phone isnât waterproof, which comes as a surprise to me since Iâve never known any phone to be waterproof and am always careful with my phones around water. Wireless charging capability is also missing from this phone so you may miss that feature if wireless charging is your thing.  It really isn't a big deal though since the battery lasts so long this phone is rarely on the charger anyway.This phone does take a USC-C cable so it isn't compatible with the cables from older Android and Kindle devices, which use Micro USB cables.  It comes with one USB-C cable but you may want to purchase another if you like extra ones around the house or in the car.  Again, not a huge deal because of the battery life.Summary: This is an outstanding phone and should work well for the vast majority of users. It operates and looks far more expensive than it really is, making me realize how much the phone companies are ripping us off selling overpriced phones. It wins in value, setup, camera, operating speed and battery life. Minor points are lost for missing some of the fancier features like wireless charging and being a different charging cable than most people already have, but those donât weigh heavily on my opinion of this Google Pixel 4a so I am giving this a strong four stars.",Pixel 4a
"It has been a long wait, as my old Pixel continued to deteriorate, but glad that I was able to upgrade to now my favorite Android phone. The Pixel 4a is amazing, the colors are a little bit different than my old Pixel, but I know I had the same situation when I was moving from my Nexus 5x. This phone is beautiful and with multiple applications open, it's fast and smooth. I'm using the eSim with T-Mobile and that works great. I have spent a couple hours using it and really no complains, it's light, but not flimsy and my Spigen Hybrid case doesn't add much to it.",Pixel 4a
"I was very excited about this phone. I read multiple glowing reviews. Phone arrived yesterday and I've spent several hours with it. I am coming from a 3-year old Samsung Galaxy S8. There's nothing really wrong with that phone. It's just not getting updates anymore and I liked the thought of a pure Android phone. The S8 had some quirks such as a big delay in being able to take a picture while Google Maps was active (bad for road trips).Here are some thoughts/findings about the 4a vs the S8:1. On the 4a I find it a bit frustrating to not being able to close apps as easily as on the S82. The S8 camera has more options - including a pro mode. I think it still takes marginally better pictures than the 4a3. The Gboard has a space and down button at the bottom which is impossible to remove. Gboard on S8 does not have this4. I find it very easy to hit the back button gesture by mistake on the the 4a and then have to open the app again5. I immediately installed a case and screen protector on the 4a, but it still feels like I could easily drop it6. The battery life isn't that great on the 4a - about the same as the 3 year old S8 I'd say7. Stereo speakers on the 4a is nice - but you have to hold it about a foot away from your face to get the effect8. 128 GB of included storage on the 4a is nice (vs 64 GB on the S8), but I also have a 200 GB SDCard in the S89. 4a gets hot! It has complained about not being able to do a few things (transcribe for example) because it was too hotJury is still out if it will replace the S8 or not. And if it does replace it, what happens to the old phone? It's only worth $100 or less.I'd say if you were looking for a great phone for the money, and it's better that what you currently have, definitely get the 4a as it's a good price and has a lot of great features. However, carefully compare it against what you currently have as it might not really be that much better.",Pixel 4a
"Though I've only had this Pixel 4a a few days, it has been great so far.  The phone came roughly 60% charged and, as far as I can see, didn't require any security updates right away. I was able to open the box and start set-up right away without waiting for charging. The instructions for set-up were good.  The box has the cord thingy so you can easily transfer everything from your old Pixel phone to the new one in about 15 minutes or less. It also included a little tool thingy to help get the SIM card out.  This was a nice and unexpected bonus that saved a lot of grief.  The transfer of everything from the old Pixel to the 4a was smooth and didnât take a ton of time; the most frustrating part is having to remember your google password, and any other passwords for apps you had on the previous phone.  Also some settings needed to be readjusted.  As of now, I don't seem to have lost anything, though 8 of my contacts transferred without the names. To clarify: the numbers were there in recent texts without a name attached to them but I was able to read the previous texts and determine whose number it was so I could add them as a new contact by using the 3 little vertical dot thingys on each text. I loved my flagship Pixel but knew I needed a new one because the old one wasn't being supported anymore and performance was getting slower.  I chose the Pixel 4a largely due to the fact that the Pixels don't have all the bloatware that comes with Samsung and other brands. I don't use FB or Twitter or a lot of those other apps that take up space and not having these unneeded apps on my phone was a huge deal for me. I like having it be our choice whether to put an app on my phone rather than having these forced on us. I also like the Google Keep for notes and the Google Calendar since I had these on previous phones and everything transferred to this Pixel 4a smoothly. Another good factor is the price of the 4a (this was significant in our decision), particularly because it seems to have everything I need and not a bunch of stuff I don't need or want. An additional plus is the larger screen (no bezel) while still keeping the small size of the phone. The screen looks classy and it's small enough to not be a problem getting in and out of a pocket or purse.  Everything is faster and smoother than the old Pixel. The plastic hardware isn't a big deal to me because I use a solid wallet-case for my phones so protection is provided & people don't see the outside of the phone anyway. There are a few nice, new 'bells and whistles' to learn if you are going from an older Pixel but they are good things and nothing to cause great frustration so far. I'm still struggling a little with the gesture thingy - and how to double-tap to get recently used apps to come up so we can close them all out.  I liked the way we did it on the old Pixel better - but I am adjusting.  Iâm also noticing that the new camera seems to be saving 2 of every cameral shot (supposedly one is for editing) and this is annoying because they take up extra space and we rarely edit our photos, so we have to delete the duplicate almost every time. I sure hope Google photos fixes this issue soon.  Iâm hoping this review might help others who are considering an upgrade to the Pixel 4a.  Overall, the upgrade from the flagship Pixel (or Pixel One, or whatever they call it now) appears to have been a good move.",Pixel 4a

   Just got the pixel 4a on Friday release day when all the Amazon units started arriving, 3 days ago and loved it. Battery life seemed great and the phone was snappy. But after the 2nd day I noticed the 4a would not stop rebooting and I could not figure it out as I was not running any new apps. After scratching my head and playing around with it, it seems to be a physical build quality issue where the battery power source is interrupted. See the video of me tapping the phone on my desk and it just turning off, repeatable every time. After I filmed this video the phone would not turn back on. I posted this issue to Reddit and someone else confirmed they had the exact same issue. There must be some major quality control issue.",Pixel 4a

"No user manual, not in the box, not online.  It seems the only available information is on Google's Pixel Phone Help web page and on the phone itself.  Both assume I know enough about what I don't know to search for it.  According to one post, the rationale for limiting user information to online help is the rapid pace of change.  That's what versioning is for:  new release, new version of the manual.  It's no more difficult than updating online help.  Both formats are useful; each serves a different purpose.I may be wrong, but I suspect the company's refusal to produce a user manual is evidence of the disdain with which Google engineers view their user community.  The attitude is not uncommon among software developers.  I know whereof I speak; I am a software developer, though not for Google.And, yes, I returned the phone.",Pixel 4a
"An important smartphone release at a time when there seems to be a real shift away from flagship devices and a move toward mid range value propositions. And with the global economic challanges ahead, the release of the Pixel 4a could be a watershed moment.The form factor is ideal for me. Whilst I understand the benefits of larger screens, the tradeoffs are too big IMO. The 4a is just so easy to handle and carry and it is so light!The pure Android is a plus. I have had bloatware on my previous two devices (Huawei) so it is a welcome change. The option to 'pause' apps is great too.Battery is good. Easily a full day. I now have battery saver mode set to auto-enable at 75% and can get 1.5 days of moderate usage.I have not had a chance to use the camera much at all but can say that the colours are an improvement over my Huawei P30 and so is the video stabilization. The P30 has an excellent camera with some advantages over the 4a but I like the results from the 4a more.As an aside, the P30 was a form favourite of mine, the best smartphone I had owned. Ticked a lot of boxes including its compact for factor. It edges the 4a on performance (the 4a does suffer from occasional lags and stutters) and has a few extra features like face unlock and onscreen fingerprint reader. But the 4a has nudged in front of the P30, albeit only slightly.Anyway, I am sold on the 4a. It delivers in spades. I don't need wireless charging nor do I drop my phones in water. I don't need a 90+hz display (the 4a's OLED display is excellent BTW) nor do I need facial recognition. I like having the option of a headphone jack though and I like having extra money to spend on other things in life.I have purchased the Spigen Rugged Armour case which provides excellent protection.",Pixel 4a
"Super fast, she is coming from a Samsung S8 and I have the S9. This phone is pretty awesome, we are willing to give up our wireless charging to have a fast phone at a cheaper price. Sucks it isn't at least water proof but we'll take that chance I guess. Anyways wife is happy and I just ordered one for myself.",Pixel 4a
"Their is currently a nasty bug in Android 11 that affects the Pixel 4a(Including myself). While using a screen protector, you will get phantom touches and unresponsive scrolling. Navigation gestures are unresponsive or erratic. Gesture style keyboards are nearly impossible to use. It really gets bad when the phone gets hot, which doesn't take long at all when you're using it.I've been pulling my hair out dealing with the issue. Hope a fix is coming. Been this way since Android 11 dropped. The Issue was not present in Android 10.Plus side. The camera on the phone is absolutely superb. This thing takes awesome clear crisp pictures. Fast charging and sleek body design. Doesn't feel cheaply made. Speakers are loud and the phone is perfectly sized.This will be a 5 star once Google fixes the sensitivity issue!Update: October security patch just came out and Google fixed the issue. Yaay. I cannot reproduce the touchscreen sensitivity issue.",Pixel 4a
"You know the scam on the street when someone tries to direct you to a certain store to buy garbage items so that they can get a kickback? Yeah, it's like that.  Was using the Honor 6x with Android 7. Was excited to get the updated system. Sorely disappointed!  What have done Google?!? So much bloatware on this. Everything has some ad you cannot get rid of (I'm looking at your Print store ad in G Photos here!) Terrible photo/file management. Very poor notification management. When I open my phone, I want to see MY stuff, not YOUR garbage! The app icon management leaves MUCH to be desired. Messaging? What a crowded bunch of ""enhanced"" options. That not enhanced, it is just useless clutter. Oh look, yet another notification for Call blocking while I write this! Yep, third one today and have the notifications turned off. Not from apps I have installed but from Android itself. Glad this has a long return option as I will continue to test it out but so far...the 3 year old phone from a much-maligned company has you BEAT! (and it was $100+ cheaper!)",Pixel 4a
"I just received this pixel 4a and have already experienced video call issues in terms of the quality, on whatsapp and duo. My callers get terribly pixelated videos of me that are so bad that they can't even see my face anymore. And other times it gets so blurry and visually noisy especially in low light settings, with a pixelated areas. I know it is not my internet speed because I've never experienced this before with my last pixel xl phone. I noticed this issue before the Android 11 update but it still continued afterwards. Nothing changes even after I restart. The phone is not even a day old. I'm not sure what to do now. I was so excited to finally receive the phone after waiting for so long, but this is unacceptable.",Pixel 4a
"Pros:- Clean android layer experience.- A main camera but achieves its goal.- Decent storage : 128 GB, no SD memory slot.- 6GB RAM, for many open applications or other activities.- If you like small phones this is an ideal size.- Good display OLED.- Jack 3.5 mmConst:- Plastic body.- The speakers are stereo, but when listening too loud there is some distortion.- Snapdragon SDM730 instead of an SDM765, the processor is good but if you compare this phone with other mid-range phones, you have a difference.",Pixel 4a
"I've used this phone for a full day. The cameras are fantastic, the display is good (but small for my taste). Haven't used the battery too much (+ the google battery AI hasn't been trained yet), so can't judge on that. The extra RAM here is great -- I went through my social media, then went back to a heavy game (GTA SA) and it was surprisingly still in memory! I've noticed the phone gets really hot throughout the day, especially when you're charging and using it for video calls. The phone even said that it would start disabling features due to overheating. So maybe avoid charging the phone and using it. That's the only bummer I've had with this phone -- that aside, this is a fantastic budget phone.",Pixel 4a
I used this phone for about 2 weeks and constantly was dropped from data. This made the phone essentially useless since several times I could not make a phone call in the middle of town with great reception. I took it in to AT&T and they got it to work in the store. 5 minutes later it was the same thing. I got so frustrated that I gave up. Nothing like buying a new phone and being excited about it and then not having it work most of the time.,Pixel 4a

"I had the Pixel 3a XL prior to ordering this phone, but my wife needed a better phone, so I ordered this one and gave her my 3a XL as she wanted the larger size.My biggest concern was the screen size difference, but with the slim bezels on the 4a, the overall screen size is really not much different when compared to the 3a XL. You can see a slight difference when you hold them side to side, but in practical terms of use, its very neglible.As for the phone itself...I love it! It has the awesome camera I have come to love with the Pixel lineup, the fingerprint reader is still in place, it has more memory and RAM than the prior model and the size is much more manageable than the 3a XL was. While I do have very large hands, the smaller physical size of the phone is just much easier to handle, and much easier to operate one handed.Prior to my Pixel 3a XL, I had the Huawei Mate 10 Pro - which I absolutely loved. I have also had Nexus and Galaxy phones, as well as a few other more budget friendly phones.For the MONEY - this phone is an absolute slam dunk! Everything you need, nothing you don't.Full Transparency - I am not a gamer, so I can not attest to how it holds up in heavy gaming. But beyond that, it works wonderfully.If there is any downside, it is the battery. Not that it's small... I have gotten through all day on more than one occasion. However, with my slightly more than average use, I do find myself needing to top off late in the evening. The good news is that in as little as 15 mins, this thing will charge up 50% or more, so it's not a huge deal. If you are going to go out for the evening, just plug it up while you are getting ready, and you'll be more than good to go!They claim that the adaptive battery software will continue to optimize the phone's battery life over time, so we'll see how that goes. But despite that, it is still a phone I would recommend ALL DAY LONG, especially when comparing to other phones in this price point.Oh, and having just one color choice?? What does that really matter, especially when virtually all of us put some sort of case on the phone. There's a good variety of cases to add color, so don't let that stop you.",Pixel 4a
"This is literally everything I could ever want or need in a phone. I do not give two craps about multiple cameras or 90hz screens. The Pixel 4a is absolutely stunning for it's low price point. Double the storage than my last phone, a better camera, better screen, fantastic OS, updates for three years, free google photos storage.. and all for 50$ less than my previous phone!The camera is the selling point for me. It is just as good as the cameras on flagship phones, and it's only one camera. Google's software really seriously kicks ass.The touch screen is snappy and I don't find myself wishing it was faster, it responds immediately to touch, scrolls fast and looks vibrant.The screen to body ratio is perfect, really great job removing bezels.The hole punch is not at all irritating, I've had the phone about three weeks now and I am completely used to it. It blends in and works well with what is on the screen and there are plenty of wallpapers to suit it. It is much better than a notch of a bezel. It looks cool I think.The base storage being 128GBs is seriously nuts. My last phone I only got 64gbs, because in order to get the 128gb version it was $100 more! With 128gbs and free google storage, I can't imagine needing more space ever, really.I'm really enjoying the phone, it's nice to hold even with a case, it's lightweight and pleasant to view and type on. I don't imagine myself getting another phone for at least 5 years. It is an absolute powerhouse of a buy, highly recommend.",Pixel 4a
"Why not include a USB-C Cable with phone order? Was this a mistake -- or was Google trying to force me to buy the right cable on day 1?  This was NOT convenient & NOT nice!  A C-to-C cable was indeed included, however, with C on both end,  I could not plug it to my portable charger nor laptop.The Pixel 4a camera is very nice -- the night sky photo is beyond stunning - camera deserves a 6 star rating!  I have not tested other features of phone.",Pixel 4a

"This phone is my first android phone and I can say the 5.8 inch makes the phone size perfect on my hands. The light and slim body is a plus.Camera - The camera is comparable to that of the iPhone 11 Pro Max the Samsung Galaxy s20 Ultra. This is one of the only budget phones that has night mode which beats the more expensive SE that doesnt have it.Speakers - At this price, you wouldn't expect the speaker to sound. Believe it or not, the stereo speaker sounds pretty good. Mids are decent, bass are present. Microphone also works great.Cons: No wireless charging. That's it. That's the only con.Other than that, this phone is suitable for those looking for phones thats geared towards value. If you are a student, this phone is for you.",Pixel 4a

There are hundreds of reports of the same issue on Google's support site. The worst thing is Google knows about this issue with Android 11 but hasn't done anything to fix it for weeks.So if you plan on getting this phone and using it with a screen protector, DON'T EXPECT IT TO WORK.Pixel 4a + Android 11 + screen protector = garbage.",Pixel 4a

"This is my first Pixel phone coming from an iPhone which I absolutely loved and didn't think I would change brands. But with all the great recommendations from online tech reviewers who got it in advance I thought I would take a chance at Google with the Pixel 5. I am so glad I did! I ordered from Amazon because shipping was way faster (yay for prime 1-day shipping!) vs ordering direct from Google and waiting a week.This phone is nice and ""small"" and fits great in my hand compared to all the huge phones we have out today. Battery life is VERY good and I love that is has fast wireless charging. I picked up a 10W wireless charger from Amazon too. Little things like the Now Playing feature which identifies the song that is playing in the background and gives you a notification are amazing (uses the same chip as the one that listens for ""Ok Google"" command). The display (which can also be set to be ""always-on"") is very nice and smooth scrolling due to 90 hertz refresh rate (refreshes 90 frames for second) compared to regular phones which are 60 hertz. It makes the phone feel faster almost bouncy and text is sharper. The cameras are amazing, especially in low light. I am still amazed how it makes rooms dimly lit look so bright and crisp. I've never seen anything like it from a camera phone. It's a very easy camera to use and almost 95% of the time you get an amazing shot.Everything on this phone just works, seamlessly and efficiently. There are so many features that I haven't listed that make this device just a pleasure to use everyday. Google has certainly knocked it out of the park with the Pixel 5. Get it and see for yourself!",Pixel 5

"This is the best choice for a modern phone in 2020!  It has great power-efficient specs, 90 Hz display, long-lasting battery, all-screen design (no notch!), very responsive fingerprint reader (for those who cannot use face unlock), minimum 3 years software support from Google (stock Android!) and 5G (for those who really want that).  It also has other features you would expect like USB-C and it supports all of those higher bitrate Bluetooth codecs like aptX and LDAC.  Note that with the all-screen design, there are limited options for positioning the built-in speakers (not front facing), so there is one at the top under the display and the other one is on the bottom side.

Battery life (reviews werent lying regarding easy 7hr SOT) attached photos3. Size is perfect4. Light weight5. Camera.. every photo blows me away and the portrait mode is almost as good as my Sony A6400.6. Volume adjustment location on right side which makes it very easy to reach.7. Speakers aren't as bad as they say. Sound really decent at least my unit, you can switch to Mono Audio in dev options to make it sound better. (it is not the best though, if you care so much about audio you won't like it)8. Fingerprint reader is very quickStuff that I didn't like:1. Google doesn't support my country for 5G (Bahrain)2. Google doesn't support my country for WiFi Calling3. Storage UFS 2.0 (not a deal breaker but 3.1 would've made apps and update install way quicker)4. Camera sensor, i would imagine how even better the camera will be if they added a new sensor. Even though the camera will be the best thing about this device for sure.5. No face unlock6. Phone calls can be annoying sometimes because you don't know where exactly to place your ears as the speaker is hidden under the displayMy phone did not have a screen gap at all and google said even if it did it wouldn't affect water resistance.I will update this review once i find anything to addEDIT:If someone is facing proximity sensor issue which is being on at all times (I didn't), make sure to disable Flip to Shh, if that didn't work, factory reset your phone but do not copy data using a Cable, continue the setup and restore your data through WiFi.For some reason, my WhatsApp voice notes activates the sensor and the screen will go black if i hover over it, even though its just a voice note, and in Clash Royale game the sensor is always on but does nothing. I tried on COD Mobile it wasn't on. so its kind of weird i hope its fixed in software update :)-UPDATE- 15 Nov: The WhatsApp voice note sensor issue is gone somehow maybe it was caused by some app, the phone is still running strong and haven't noticed any hiccups, just sometimes in Instagram (only), everything else seems great and I'm so happy that I switched to this phone from Galaxy Note 10 Plus. I don't think i'll go back to a non pure android phone.-UPDATE- 23 Nov: added number 6 in stuff that i dont like, still very happy with this phone and everyone is saying the photos that ive taken are really nice, in all situations this camera will make you happy. Still running smooth and battery life is great.",Pixel 5
"I've been a long time Pixel user, having used all the Pixels since the original Pixel & I have to say this is the best one yet.First off, my primary reason for switching to the Pixel 5 was battery life. Coming from a Pixel 4, the battery life is atrocious, I usually get about 2-3 hours of screen on time at most & would have to top up at least once during the day to ensure I have enough to last me through the night. Upon using the Pixel 5 for about a week, I can confirm that the battery life is no longer an issue. Thanks to the upgrade in battery size this time around,  I can easily get about 4-5 hours of screen on time, with heavy usage(ie. bluetooth, music, social media, etc.). I don't tend to game on phones, hence i cannot opine on that front, but I am confident that the battery will handle that just as well.Pixel phones are among the best, if not the best, for taking photos, hence you can rest assured that it's quite easy to take awesome quality photos, without putting in much effort. The dual camera setup, features the standard wide angle & an ultra wide angle sensor. Coming from the Pixel 4, I wasn't too happy when Google opted for the Telephoto lenses instead of the ultra wide, hence I'm glad they updated that setup this year. I will say that the ultra wide isn't as wide as compared to other smartphones(which may be due to the effort to minimize image distortion) but the quality is on par with the usual Pixel quality you would expect.I was a bit worried with the punch hole cutout for the front facing camera, but turns out it's not really noticeable unless you really look for it, as the UI blends in quite well with the symmetrical bezels, creating the impression that you're using a bezel-less screen., which is quite pleasing.Overall, I feel like this is the most matured & well balanced Pixel phone that Google has designed so far. It doesn't have all the bells & whistles of the more expensive ""premium"" phones, but I think that wasn't the mission here. The Pixel 5 was designed with the fundamentals in mind, which means executing all the day to day stuff well, without throwing everything at the wall to see what sticks. If you're looking for a well balanced, all around Android phone, the Pixel 5 is Pixel Perfect.",Pixel 5
"The phone has a design flaw whereas a lot of customers are facing an issue with the proximity sensor affecting the always on display, tap to wake, lift to wake, speakers, etc. rendering them useless. This is not the flickering issue, this is an issue with the sensor itself not doing what is it supposed to do. Amazon customer service was great again and offered me a replacement or a refund, I went for the replacement and will update when the new unit arrives. Very bad #google.UPDATE: So I received the replacement unit and I've decided to give up on Google. I'm attaching several photos to show the ugly green white tint at the top of the display. The replacement unit didn't come with a defective proximity sensor, but I can't use the phone with this ugly tint, I cranked the exposure in one of the photos so that the tint appears clearly.  I didn't pay this amount to get a defective phone. I'm returning the case too.",Pixel 5
"Coming from a Pixel 4XL, I was missing the fingerprint reader and ultra-wide lens.  So I thought I would give the next gen Pixel a try.  Here's my thoughts...1.  First and foremost, Google should be making a 5-XL variant of this phone for those who want the larger format, like me.  They are not going to though.2.  The phone is too small, even for a smaller version of Pixel...it's too small IMO.3.  They should have kept the zoom lens AND added the ultra-wide for a 3 lens setup.4.  Face ID should be an option, however it doesn't exist on this phone.5.  The cheaper processor is ok, it gets the job done.All the above warranted a return of the device for me.  I'm back on my Note 20 Ultra, with my Pixel 4XL as a backup.",Pixel 5
"I used to have a Pixel 2 XL  and decided to replace it with the Pixel 5. The phone is much more compact than the 2 XL but still has the same screen height. The width of the screen is less so overall surface is less as well. I mostly don't notice it but when I watch videos then I do notice. Other people might just like a compact phone and the Pixel is very compact and light. I don't want to go through the hassle of returning this phone but next time I'll go for a phone with a bigger screen.This phone may not be for everyone. Not only is the screen smaller then some other phones with similar prices, the CPU is also slower then competing phones. That is no issue for me as I don't play games on my phone and using apps and navigating through menus is plenty fast for me.The reason I bought the phone is the clean Android user experience coupled with the long battery life and this phone is certainly delivering on those features. Overall, this is a great phone but it is just a bit too expensive for what it is. A price $100 to $200 lower would have been more reasonable.",Pixel 5

If not for that major deal breaker, I would have returned the pixel 5 instead.",Pixel 5
"Pros:Finger print reader on back, so easy to unlock your phone.Plenty of storage and speed for most users even playing gamesWireless charging, order a wireless charger for your work desk it's worth it.Pure Android, google phones run on latest possible android version and it's usually amazingCamera is good, night time vision is good not great.Cons:Battery life is good, not what Samsung or iPhone arePhone call quality on device, hearing people is not super clear on phone through Google Fi, although wireless ear buds are super clear.Overall I would recommend this phone to anyone who uses their cell phone frequently for almost all uses. Value compared to more expensive phones is tough to beat. Google customer service is also top notch if you have an issues.",Pixel 5
"My first Pixel, first phone with anything faster than 600 series Snapdragon in it, first 90 hz screen, first OLED.My budget phones were larger though, and I wasn't sure this smaller size would work out ok.Super thin bezels took a bit of getting used to--accidentally triggering things. But about got it down now.Smaller size is working out fine. Better than fine. Liking it.Feel is very solid. This is the first phone I've preferred using without a case... Not glass, and not slippery. It's a treat to handle.Works great with my MVNO (Ultra Mobile, T-Mobile network).Battery life is noticeably longer than my last phone as well.I like understated styling--power that doesn't make a big show of it. If you're into that, you'll probably like this phone. It's attractive, but the good looks are subtle.",Pixel 5
Just switched from the I phone 11 pro to this new pixel and hand down a better phone. I thought the 12 pro was just over priced and wanted to switch things up and I'm happy I did. The camera and the battery and that 90 hrs just can't be best. Plus getting pure android with no bloat ware is a huge plus in my mind. And the price is perfect. I know they put the smaller chip set in this so we see how holds up over time but one month in and has not for anything but faster.  Recommend to anyone who is tired of paying over a 1000 dollars for a flag ship phone. Oh and now only pixel owners get free unlimited photo storage any more. Really that's how google should have been doing it all along. Like if your going to not buy a google phone why should you expect free cloud storage. Think it's a wise move on google end.,Pixel 5
"This phone is an awful piece of hardware.  I've always had pixel phones and thought I'd ""upgrade"" from my aging pixel 3 XL.I knew it wasn't a flagship but I figured it's gotta be better than a 2 generation old phone?No.  This phone is garbage and worse in every measurable way than a pixel 3.  Screen is so bad... so bad.  The speakers are worse, the camera is worse, the phone is slow, it feels cheap, it's light as a feather, it's tiny.Don't order this.  Save up for something better.",Pixel 5
I switched from a Galaxy S10. This is in comparison to that phone. Overall I liked it. Doesn't overheat like Galaxy and battery lasts all day with hours of gaming.Pros:Very lightFastIntelligent and adaptiveNo bloatwareGreat battery lifeLove the aluminum bodyCons:Terrible speakerCamera resolution sub par compared to S10Screen resolution not as sharpWhy is the phone not flush??? Camera sticks out in the back!,Pixel 5
"1. Gap2. Speaker is terrible3. Screams CHEAPMy expectations were low, but holy cow!",Pixel 5
"So this is what a phone should be. It's not top of the line, but it's great. It's not a phablet, it's the size a phone should be. Android auto just works. Wifi signal and cellular signal are both great. Has wireless and reverse wireless charging for convenience. Will receive updates for a while since it's google and it has all the native android things. 5g on TMobile is fast for sure.All for a very reasonable price and package. Cannot complain at all, and just overall love the phone.",Pixel 5
"I didn't want to change from the Pixel 2xl, but security and updates and all. I loved that phone! Guess what, this one is great.  Mid-level price is nice.  It functions just as well/faster and I have a better battery.  Camera delivers as much as the iphone 12...just a second for processing delay.  No gap.  I had been worried about the speaker issue and laughed at the reviewers when I tried it out....it isn't that bad.  And I use earbuds anyway.Sure, it isn't a flagship due to the chip.  But it is a good solid phone that is better for the things I value than many of those flagships.  I'm glad I took the chance and stayed with the Pixels.",Pixel 5
Heathing problem I think this phone is a defected peace . To much heating and late charge like 5 hour  and battery like  one hour what is this.totally dissatisfied,Pixel 5
"While there are lots of concerns around this latest version due to the processor, I have no issues with the device. I actually prefer the trade-off of speed for battery life. Excellent phone, good battery life, great camera and unbloated os makes it the perfect phone for me.",Pixel 5
"Coming from a Pixel 3 XL, I hoped this would be a worthwhile upgrade. The battery life is awesome, and I seem to have better cell connectivity, but the camera is awful.Some googling revealed others have this issue as well and Google has yet to acknowledge the issue. Front and back cameras perform poorly in low light, and in good lighting the cameras lack the sharpness of older phones.",Pixel 5
"Great phone all around. Takes wonderful pictures, fast, and responsive. Also has great battery life. My old phone I would have to charge at least once throughout the day. With this phone it lasts from the time I bring it off the charger until I go to bed at night. The only thing people may not like about it is it is a little bit smaller than most phones on the market but I actually prefer the slightly smaller size because it's easier to hold.",Pixel 5
"Coming from a couple of years with Samsung I find this phone refreshing and close to the ideal phone. I have none of the screen gap issues some owners complain of and it's just the right size. It's sturdy and has nice responsiveness. I don't regret this phone purchase for a second, it's my first Pixel and I doubt I'll ever go back to Samsung.",Pixel 5
"I sadly cannot connect the phone to my car or headphones because of lack of bluetooth backward compatibility.  I also just tried to connect it to a Samsung Fit 2 watch and because the Android OS is out ahead of Samsung, that won't connect either.  Just some issues I did not foresee.  But it's a fantastic phone and I love the new OS features.",Pixel 5
"This is a great phone. Performance is super smooth, camera is stunning, and the battery life has been the biggest surprise for me. It lasts me 2 days EASY. The phone has a solid build, feels great in the hand and I especially love being able to handle the entire thing with one hand. This is hands down the best compact Android phone out there now with an amazing camera and great battery life.",Pixel 5
Phone is great but DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON . You can not Esim with google fi. And I'm sure other things are different. Wifi calling didn't work on the phone purchased from Amazon.,Pixel 5
"So far (3 days in) it's been amazing. Charges super quick, great pictures, amazing display. One very crucial thing is to transfer over all your old data when setting up phone as it's not doable after. I assume it's a bug but only took 5 min to factory reset and re transfer everything over. Hopefully it continues to impress",Pixel 5
"I really like this phone. Battery life is great, even with some gaming. Love the screen even with the pin hole camera.Only cons (not worth docking a star): No Micro SD slot and under screen speaker can sound a little tinny, but I mainly use wireless earbuds anyway.",Pixel 5
"It is an amazing phone. Super handy and great quality except for earpiece sound quality. Camera quality is amazing. Battery lasts longer than a day, close to two days, for a regular user who needs a phone to use as a phone not a gaming console. The only downside is the earpiece sound quality. It doesn't have a clear sound because it is located under the screen and there is no hole in the upper part of the phone to deliver the sound (I know it is a new technology). If you are using a headphone to talk, this phone satisfies your needs.",Pixel 5
"Went to get this on googles site. 12 day waiting and $35 restock fee. Got it the next day from Amazon, same phone.",Pixel 5
"Far  better than i was expecting. Super easy to use, migration was effortless, hardware and features are absolutely amazing.",Pixel 5
Very happy with this purchase. Unlocked phone works perfectly for T-Mobile. Moved SIM card over and that's it. Good overall value for hardware provided. Fingerprint reader works great.,Pixel 5
"It's a very good smartphone but it's not excellent and, in my opinion, it's a little expensive.In general I'm happy with it, but I'm very disappointed with the speakers. They don't have the quality sound for a U$S 700 smartphone.",Pixel 5
"I love it. I upgraded from a pixel 2 and I absolutely love it. It was totally worth the upgrade. The battery life is amazing. The screen clarity is great and the colors pop. If you're looking for a great phone with an amazing camera and a great battery life, this is the phone for you.",Pixel 5
Its quite sad that Google decided to skip the upgrade to its lineup.,Pixel 5
"The best battery life of any android phone. Also, if you're interested in an android phone, look no further",Pixel 5

"I believe this is my first time trying out a Google phone. I like the performance. It  has features and capabilities like the premium priced phones. It doesn't have the actual physical feel of a premium phone, though, so it is a trade off.I currently use a Samsung S20 5G, as well as a Samsung Note 20 5G. Don't ask me why I needed both, I just do, ok?  lol Eye candy plays a lot into it, and that is not something you get with the Pixel 5. That is ok though because you also don't have to worry about your whole phone shattering. The back is not glass like on the Samsung and the screen doesn't seem to be as fragile. It just feels more like something that can take a little more of a beating, but not like the old Nokia brickhouses.It has a bit of a lightweight feel and is comfortable in my hand.It is very responsive to touch. There are no lags with anything. You touch and it responds immediately.Camera is very nice. Takes really good pics in my opinion, and has a lot of nice features. For even more options, you can always download other apps to use, as well. I think most people nowadays use several camera apps, anyway.The biggest issue for me was just getting used to the operating system and layout - the difference in getting places, closing out apps, browsers, etc. I have used Samsung phones for so long that using them is second nature and autonomous. You don't realize how much you do things without thinking about them until you try something new. So I was naturally trying to use the same swipes and gestures to do things (despite there being a very simple, quick, walk-through showing you how to do it). I had to retrain my hands and think about what I was doing. But that goes away fast once in the habit. If you're already used to Google phones, you probably won't have that issue.Call quality is fine on AT&T. Video quality and video call quality are both perfect. I don't feel like I am losing out on anything vs my Samsung.Really, the only major noticeable difference is with the aesthetics. The physical look and feel. This phone is stripped down to basic for the body, but has all of the important operating functions, features, and performance. Once you throw a case on it, you change the look and feel anyway, and can customize to your taste.This phone doesn't feel like it *needs* a case is another benefit. I do not feel like i have to guard it with my life and protect it against daily life.I feel like it is a great value for a phone if you don't have to have the flashy, fancy, fragile phones. It certainly performs just as well as the thousand+ dollar phones.",Pixel 5
"INITIAL IMPRESSIONS:ChargingThis smartphone can even be charged with the new Apple charging disk, AND it can charge otherQi-certified devices by placing them on itâs back.Camera/PhotosMy initial testing showed the this smartphone takes excellent photos including the ability to easily take guided panoramas, and portrait photos. (See my photos)BodyThe phone body itself is cool, with glass front and a leather-like back.SecurityThe smartphone uses fingerprint security, with the touchpoint on the back of the phone. At first it seems like a weird place to have that, but after a while it becomes second nature to use.SIZEThis smartphone is small, compared to the Apple Phone 11 Pro Max. At first I found the font too small o read, but you can adjust font size in the settings, and after I made it LARGE, I was able to read the green much easier.APPSFinding popular apps is easy, with Facebook, Instagram, Netflix, Zoom, Twitter, HBO Max, Spotify, Amazon Prime Video, NY Times, Facebook, Messenger, easily downloadable from the Google Play store.VIDEO OUTAlthough the phone has a USB C port on it, the USB C to HDMI adapter that I tried to use to stream video to an external projector did not work. The Google Pixel 5 does not support this.TO DO:I am awaiting a SIM chip from Xfinity Mobile to test out the local area 5G network, and will update this review when thatâs complete.",Pixel 5
"This phone is a definite learning curve from my Note 10+ .  The processor seems to be way faster than the Note and the s20. Transferring content was done in 20 minutes for 65gb of pics, videos,  ect...  My Note to s20 was over 1.5 hours.The camera works beautifully,  one of the best I've had. Internet is fast, faster than my Note and s20 by a decent clip. Browsing is seamless, very very little hesitation between sites, if any. I dont know enough to run the actual tests, this is just a normal person experience. This phone is smooth operating with a nice camera.What I didnt know was there is no Back button. You have to swipe across part of the screen to go back. Once I get it all figured out with the gestures, im sure I'll love it.I like the matte finish,  it keeps it from feeling like I'm going to drop it. I would definitely put a case on because you just never know.Overall,  very impressed with my first Google phone. Definitely beats the Apples in my opinion,  and dominate the S20",Pixel 5
"I've loved Google Phones since the Nexus 6P. This phone is almost perfect, with an emphasis on almost. The processing is a little slow for photos, and it is missing a headphone jack. If you are aware of these two things when you purchase it, you will love the phone. It is great quality, and you will get updates straight from Google immediately.",Pixel 5
"The Google Pixel 5 is in many respects a major step backwards.1. The chipset is a DOWNGRADE from the Pixel 4 and even the Pixel 4a's is better. Even with the software improvements in the OS for this phone, it is still SLOWER than last generation. It's weird to me that Google decided to make their newer phone slower.2. The screen's range of brightness has been reduced significantly. The darker areas no longer contrast with the bright whites of the screen as well has they have before. Instead most colors are drowned out or too dark due to the screen's lack of HDR which as present in past Pixels3. The new gesture navigation has too many issues with too many apps. There's no longer any buttons on screen and you now have to use swipes and swipe then hold to properly navigate. You do have the option to go back to the 3 button navigation as before, but that's far inferior to the 2 button navigation which is NOT an option.",Pixel 5
"Great phone.  Really enjoying my first week with it.PROS:All the pros are fairly well documented online so I won't dwell too much on them. Loving the 90hz refresh, the comfortable size, the small bezels, the 5G, the pure Android experience, the fast wireless charging, the super quick fingerprint scanner, and the excellent battery life.NON-ISSUES (FOR ME):I had a few concerns going in which turned out to be non-issues for me:1) Gap between screen and body: There were many reports online of an inconsistent gap between the screen and aluminum body of the phone, with an especially large gap near the corner with the camera.  Maybe I got lucky, but did not have this issue.  There's a VERY small gap on my phone, but it's consistent all the way around, appears to be by design, and doesn't bother me at all.2) Speakers: I'm coming from a Pixel 2 which has stereo front firing speakers.  While I do notice the lack of stereo sound on the Pixel 5, I found the overall volume and clarity of the Pixel 5 to be better actually.  Does it compete with the best phones out there in terms of sound?  Probably not.  But for my purposes it is more than adequate.  I also found the behind-screen speaker for phone calls to be fine.  It's a little weird for the whole phone to vibrate when someone's talking, but I've already gotten used to it.3) Old camera hardware: Coming from a Pixel 2 which takes good photos, the Pixel 5 is incrementally better.  It's not going to compete with an iPhone 12 Pro in all departments, but it's still good even though the main camera hardware is a couple years old.  Wide-angle is nice to have.4) Midrange processor: I really haven't noticed this being an issue yet.  Granted, I don't do a ton of photo processing or gaming on the phone.  But for everyday tasks it's totally fine.  Definitely faster and snappier than my Pixel 2, and the 90hz makes it all look buttery smooth.5) Lack of squeeze-for-assistant: I'm already getting used to swiping up from the corner.  Not really missing this feature as much as I thought I would.MINOR CONS:1) The bio-resin on edges near the screen seems a little rough, and the cutout for the USB-C port could have been rounded a bit so the edge wasn't so ""sharp"".  Neither seem like defects, but I used to use my pinky as a ledge to sit the phone on, and now that's a little uncomfortable.  Just an adjustment I'll need to make.  I don't use a case, so if you're planning on using one this issue will be moot for you.2) Screen viewing angle seems slightly narrow.  In normal use this is not an issue, but it it's not quite as good as an iPhone XS or 11.3) No telephoto.  I've never had one so I don't know what I'm missing.  I think I have more use for wide-angle so it's an ok tradeoff for me, but it would have been nice to have telephoto too.  If you have a Pixel 4 and use the telephoto a lot, this might not be the upgrade path for you.4) This is more of an Android 11/app developer issue, but a lot of apps, including some Google apps like Chrome, don't do a good job of showing off the small uniform bezels on the Pixel 5.  You still end up with black bars at the top and bottom in most cases behind the notification area at the top and the gesture line at the bottom.  They should really be transparent, especially at the bottom.  Maybe that'll improve with time, but it's hard to actually appreciate the nice bezels on the phone on anything but the home screen.All in all, this is a 5-star phone for me.  Looks great, and it's well rounded.  Recommended.",Pixel 5
"Aside from Amazon sending me the sage one instead of black, like I ordered, this phone is better than expected. Coming from a pixel 2 and knowing the 5 had a mid range processor I was expecting it to feel allot like my nexus 5x did which was good enough but sluggish. I was wrong.  It's very fast, display is amazing and it multitasks better than my pixel 2 due to having 2wice the memory. The camera is insanely good as well and I've had no problems with any of the games I play.Overall, very pleased, especially considering it's $300 cheaper then most of the flagships out there. Don't worry about the processor. It does quite well.",Pixel 5
"Really loving this phone! This thing is leaps and bounds better than the 5-year-old Samsung Galaxy S7 that I just came from. The biggest decision that held me back from upgrading all this time was the price and the size of the phones. Love that this is virtually identical to the size of the S7.Taking my Verizon Sim card from the S7 and dropping in here was a breeze. I got the phone in the morning and had 60% battery. By the end of the day, it was around 30% without ever charging the phone and I had been playing around, testing, and downloading all my apps.Speakers sound much more robust than the S7. The fingerprint reader is instant and reads it 99% of the time. The S7 would get me fumbling a lot with it. It would try to read it when I wasn't fully positioned so would lock me out a lot of times.The one thing I'm disappointed with is the wide-angle camera over a telephoto lens. The wide-angle isn't a whole lot wider than the standard lens. A telephoto would have made much more sense and taken much better photos without the need to artificially blur the background.But so far loving the phone. If you've held off from buying a new phone for a couple of years, I wouldn't hesitate to get this one. For me, it's not about having the most powerful everything. I just wouldn't take full advantage of it. This phone just has the right balance of power, size, and battery life.**UPDATE**I've since have used this phone as an actual phone, and I will say, this is an area where the 5-year-old Galaxy S7 was still better. Call quality was actually better on the S7. Since Pixel 5 has the earpiece speaker under the glass, it always sounds like there is something covering up the speaker. After a while, you don't really notice it. But was annoying right off the bat. Calls will never sound HD like they did with the S7.But I'm finding new things out with this all the time. I'm sure they've probably been around on previous Pixels, but it's a new toy right now. Actually kinda like that it constantly listens for music and keeps a list of all the music I've heard throughout the day.",Pixel 5
"1) Google Smart Home services drain the battery on this phone in about 5 hours while just sitting on a desk.2) When docked on the wireless charger, the display turns on full brightness in the middle of the night and you have to power it down to reset it.3) It has a strange problem where I can't get texts to go through with certain iPhone users. I had this problem with the Pixel 3 as well. The 5 does it worse. I can't text my wife or kid, who both just got the new iPhone. Verizon couldn't even get my texts to show up on a test iPhone when I called to figure out why. Nobody knows. They say it happens to certain Pixel phones.4) The camera is equal or worse than the Pixel 4 Pro I have. I don't think milking that camera array for another gen was the right move. Now the Pixel camera is average at best, and everyone else is catching or surpassing Google with camera tech.I really love that they brought back the fingerprint scanner and ditched the absolutely AWFUL radar face unlock from the Pixel 4. They had to roll back to the Pixel 3 to correct that mistake, and now the phone seems dated because of it.I don't know what the hype is about with the speed on this phone. Mine is kind of a dog, to be completely honest.Sadly, as I type this, I'm printing out the return papers. I haven't owned an iPhone since the 2nd gen. But, I guess its time to reluctantly jump on that apple bus again. Google missed the mark for my needs this time.",Pixel 5
I have been using my Pixel 5 for two weeks and love it. Google has a lot of promise when it comes to creating a compelling phone that feels well integrated from a hardware and software perspective similar to what Apple does with the iPhone.I got the iPhone 12 Pro before I got the Pixel 5 and ended up returning the iPhone because the software experience still leaves a lot to be desired for heavy Google services users and people who want any customization freedom whatsoever. I was considering giving up Google services in favor of the stuff that come preinstalled on iOS and my Macs but the reality is that Apple's alternatives don't come anywhere close.The Good- The software experience is incredible.- The size is perfect. Compact but not too small.- The camera is stellar.- I love the screen.- Very smooth despite all the noise about it having a mid-tier chipset. 90hz refresh rate really helps make things feel fluid.- Battery life is the best i've had on a phone period (I have been able to make it last 2 days with moderate usage).- Thank god it is ip68 certified. Is especially useful since I wash my phone off daily after the gym due to covid.The Bad- The speakers are very mediocre.- Haptics are average.- The Android 11 gesture system could use a lot of improvement. The new back gestures break things like hamburger menu swipes and Spotify album cover song swiping. iOS has gesture based navigation way more dialed in. Google should literally just copy what they have. Right now back gestures just feel like an emulated hardware back button key press from Android phones of yesteryear.- I have experience a decent amount of screen mispresses due to the fact that the display bezels are so small. I can't stress how annoying this is. This happens mostly when I am laying down and have my pointer finger anchored on the top right of the phone while using my thumb for tapping the screen. This is a usability hinderance I hope they improve the software so that it filters unwanted touches. Apple is smart about this in iOS and has certain drag thresholds for things like opening the control center. I wish Google would do similar things so that something as small as an accidental nip of the top of the screen doesn't cause the notification shade to pop completely open.- My 2 pairs of AirPod Pros both have major bluetooth issues with this phone. I almost always have to re-pair (sometimes even more than once) since the volume control on the phone does all sorts of wonky stuff on initial pair. The AirPods work fine on all my other devices.Hopefully Google decides to continue improve the software. I would still highly recommend this phone even in its current state. Coming from somebody who is very picky this phone is the clear winner for me between the iPhone 12 Pro and OnePlus 8T.Well done Google!,Pixel 5
"Great phone but google should have updated their camera hardware, feel like they were lazy.Onba side note this phone was shipped with 5 quarts of motor oil and i was scared to death i was gonna get an oily phone! Thank God nothing leaked!",Pixel 5
"I am a long-time Android fan, but this is my last Android.  Google cheaped out on the screen again. Navigation is deathly annoying, and simple tasks (like grouping or moving app shortcuts) are now much harder than they should be.  Even trying to close apps and clear notifications should not be so frustrating.  I'm done.  The new iPhone is looking better by the minute.",Pixel 5
"I really wasn't planning on getting this phone. Really, wanted to save money and get something cheap...The phone has proved me wrong.This mid cost phone offers Google's Android 11 os and works smoothly, once you get the hang of using it.The fingerprint reader works fast and is reliable. I like having the reader in the back instead of the front screen (which i find not as reliable) as well as the side where depending on location causes it to lock up often because of unintentionally touching the sensor.There is no face recognition available on it and I'm ok with that as well, never liked it (dont want to scare my phone every time I turn. It on. ð¤£)The screen size is a bit small, even at 6in display for me but it works smoothly between the 60 to 90 hrs display rate. I do wish it offered higher display then 1080 though. Most people won't be able to tell a difference but I do like a higher picture quality and refresh rate for my eyes which nitpick it to hell.Battery life has been good, not great, but the phone learns your usage and supposed to help increase battery life. The pixel forum states it takes about a week to see battery life improvements. I really have been like g the battery life on it so far.The phone comes with a 18 watt usb-c charger and cable, nice perk as u like the iPhone 12 without.Wireless charging works well and its water resistant. Nice but that should be expected at this price.Sound quality is nice but sounds tinny to me at high volume, this is because there is no speakers built in but uses a vibration technology to play sound through your phone. I'm not talking about midrange where most people are likely to use but at full blast.Camera picture quality is to be expected, Google has been beating other phone companies in image quality but they are not the leaders as they once were. They are still using the old sensor and it shows when you compare newer phones that produce nice images compatible to googles pictures.As for 5g, still have not been able to test it, but it may be better waiting to get the 4a5g.",Pixel 5
"Iâve had the Pixel, Pixel 2XL, and the Pixel 3. Iâve been following and waiting for the 5 even preordered. Now I was concerned with the reviews on places like CNET and others in short saying why pay so much for the 5 when you can get the 4a which is basically the same. I should have listened. There was really NO difference from the 5 to the 3 I just had! I was hoping for perhaps a better camera (besides calling and texting, the camera is what I use most) I was so disappointed, the only thing I noticed that was any change and a good change was the battery life was way better but certainly not for the price! I was so disappointed that I finally gave up and went to Apple. I have never owned anything in recent memory (my kids love Apple) but I went to dark side and Iâm much happier for it. Bought a used Apple iPhone X (256gb) for 300 bucks off of Facebook and havenât looked back. (My children are loving that they finally converted me ð) I think Android and I  are going to separate for a while and Iâm going to see where this new relationship goes.",Pixel 5
I bought the Pixel 3 to replace my Pixel 1 when it was beyond repair.  Never really happen with the Pixel 3 - lots of bugginess and software updates didn't fix anything.  Not to mention the battery was GARBAGE.In comes the Pixel 5.  As happy with this as I was the original Pixel (maybe more!) because it's a joy to use once again and the battery lasts like you would want it to!  Instead of having to charge multiple times a day I can forget to charge overnight and still have juice the next morning!Highly recommend for anyone looking for a solid flagship and affordable phone!,Pixel 5
"Super smart, convinient. Coming from iPhone world after 9 years, I switched to Pixel 5 and all I can say is it's way out if league of iPhone.

"I am a non-techy mom of many. My priorities for a phone reflect that. I don't care about specs, I care about usage. In my opinion, a phone should be:1 - a great camera!2 - a reliable GPS3 - allow easy access to social media & shopping4 - allow me to make phone calls as needed (yes, using it as a phone is the lowest priority for me...ha)My review will be based on these primary things, and from a non-techy mom.Overall, I like this phone a lot. I'm not over the moon about it though. I switched from a Pixel 2 and I expected more things to be different and better. But in reality, I notice few differences.The Pixel 5 is actually SMALLER than my Pixel 2. Both in depth and in length. In the long run, it's still bigger because it doesn't have the black bar at the top and bottom of the screen like the 2 does. The 5 is also lighter than the 2. It feels like a metal back. But my husband and I agree it kind of feels cheaper than the 2.There are two speaker looking things on the bottom of the phone. But only the right side is a speaker. The left side is a microphone, even though it looks like a speaker. I do not like that sound only comes from the right side of the phone. I am right handed and tend to rest my phone on my pinky while holding it up. My pinky naturally covers that speaker. It's annoying.There is another speaker at the top of the phone, under the glass. It's plenty loud enough for listening to phone conversations but it's not very loud while playing music. It kind of sounds weird to have the speakers at such different levels of sound. But I'm not super picky about my sound quality. Someone who is, won't be happy with this set up.The camera is, arguably, the most important part of a phone. And this camera is great. But it is not miles ahead of the pixel 2 and for that reason, I am very disappointed. I had really hoped I'd finally have a phone camera that takes great action shots of my kids. No. I still get blurred faces or blurred bodies. Even with I use the top shot feature, that you can use when taking action photos. Otherwise, the camera is still great. It takes beautiful portrait photos, night sight, slow mo, etc. I like that you can adjust the direction of the light or blur after taking some photos, though I'm not sure how often I'll actually use those features. I really just wish it'd take a great action shot of moving kids!The GPS works fine. I have zero complaints about it. It's easy to use and listen to.The ease of access to shopping apps and social media has taken some getting use to. There is no ""back"" button anymore to go back to another app. But there's also no ""back"" button in the browser to go back to the previous webpage. I hate that. You're suppose to swipe your finger from the right edge of the screen, leftward. That works sometimes. But often I'm on a page (like Amazon) where if you swipe, the photo changes. So it takes a couple swipes to get the page to go back one. It's annoying. You can use swipes to move from app to app as well, it's taking some getting use to for all those gestures, but I'm catching on fast. The swipe to go back in a browser is the most frustrating new gesture feature to me.And as far as using this as an actual phone, it's good. It still has the spam warning and ability to screen calls. It's really no different than the pixel 2 in that regard.Setting the phone up was a breeze. I just plugged my pixel 2 into the pixel 5 and it transferred almost everything. It transferred passwords for more than half the apps, too. That was really nice. I still had to sign in to everything again, but for about half the apps, google automatically inputted the login information for me.  It only took 15 minutes for everything to transfer. And then another hour for the apps to all update.The one annoying thing about set us is that, a week later, I still had the ""Pixel Set Up In Progress, Tap to finish Pixel Setup"" notification bar on my phone. I had two. I was able to close one, but not the 2nd one. I had to restart the phone in order to get the notification to finally disappear.Overall, I like the pixel 5 more than the 2. But only barely. I'm disappointed that this non-techy notices few differences. I'm sure there are a lot of upgrades to speed and quality, but I don't notice that in the way I use the phone. I should add, the battery is pretty great. I don't have to charge it at all during the day. And actually, I haven't charged it since 2 nights ago and I'm only down to 31% battery right now (after about 30 hours of use). That's pretty great!",Pixel 5
"I had a pixel 4xl and that thing was a LEMON. Worked great for about 6 months, then the rear camera kept breaking and none of my apps that used the rear camera would work. Was able to fix under warranty, but had to bring it in THREE times in a 2 month period and it just wasn't worth the headache anymore, so I switched to a galaxy s20. I had been a galaxy user since the 4 and LOVED it. BUT, I missed the pixel camera. The s20 didn't have a ""portrait"" mode setting, which I loved with the pixel. It also didn't let you choose when to night sight a picture (if it was dark, it would automatically night sight the shot, which takes like 10 seconds of holding still). Sometimes a low light shot is fine, but you didn't get the options with the s20.So, I'm trying out the pixel 5, and so far, I really like it. With the 5, you don't have the facial recognition unlock, which is honestly fine with me. The pixel 4 was better at it then the s20, but in the times of covid-19 I've got a face mask on half the time and the facial recognition doesn't work if you're wearing a face mask. I'm REALLY liking the finger print detection. It's in a great spot that is natural for my finger to find and has worked 99% of the time first try with no issues (will update if it gets wonky over time).I love how small this phone is. I'm a woman with average sized hands, and the bigger phones are just harder for me to navigate one handed (and I refuse to put one of those pop socket things on my phone). This one is also very light compared to my last 2 phones.I like the texture on the back of the phone, but it's irrelevant to me because I always keep my phone in a case. It has a rougher texture instead of super smooth, so it's easier to grip if you don't use a case.Speed wise, the S20 is more powerful, but I don't really notice a difference. Google decided not to put in the fastes processor for the pixel 5. Instead, you get the Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G chip, while the S20 has the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 chipset. Like I said, I don't really notice the difference, but maybe if you're playing a lot of video or gaming on your phone, you'll notice?Camera is the main reason I missed the pixel. LOVE the camer, especially the portrait mode option. I also love that night sight is a separate button, so if I want to capture a quick low light picture of my kids I can (instead of it forcing the night sight and taking 10 seconds to take the picture).I also like the google assistant and google calendar because I use gmail anyway.Plays well with my samsung watch and all of our smart things lights and whatnot.Overall, as of now, I'm loving it better than the s20.Will definitely update if it starts having issues like the 4 did. Fingers crossed they fixed that.",Pixel 5
"Setup was really easy. Soon after powering it on it ask if you would like to transfer data from your old phone. I was able to use the provided cable charging cord to transfer data and apps from my Samsung galaxy note.It takes some getting used to for navigating the phone. There's no back button, show open apps button, or home button at the bottom of the phone like I'm used to. You need to use gestures on order to do all of those actions.I like that there's not too much bloat ware, unwanted pre-installed apps that cannot be uninstalled. The Samsung had the bixby assistant that I found useless. The Google Assistant button is found at the bottom of the screen and easy access to my Google feed by swiping from the left.Apps and phone turns on quickly without any lag. The phones smaller size fits better in my hands for single hand use. I would struggle a little with that on my old Samsung. Would definitely suggest getting a screen protector as well as a case. Until I get those in trying not to scratch the front screen or the glass over the rear camera lens. All physical buttons are easily accessible on the right side of the phone. Simple power on/lock phone button as well as volume controls.The Fingerprint scanner is no where near as advanced as other phones such as the Note 9.Battery - there are some battery saving settings included on the phone to assist with ensuring your not wasting your battery on unneeded things.Finding a decent phone case has not been easy as this phone is so new.",Pixel 5
"I have used iPhones for the last decade, so this is my first foray into Android phones.  The Pixel 5 seems to be agood option for an Android phone.  I was intrigued by this phone because it seemed to have many options found on more expensive phones, but at a lower price point.  So far, I am pleased with its performance and capabilities.As with anything new, it takes a little getting used to, but it is very comparable to the iPhone in its operation.  The kit comes with the phone, a charge cord and block, a quick switch iPhone adapter, and a manual.  The screen size is taller than my previous iPhone, but it is not as wide.  While I would prefer a wider screen, it will do.  I would also prefer if the app icons were larger.  Despite adjusting the display to maximum size, they are still small.  My prior phone would display four icons in each row, but the Pixel displays five.  More icons on a smaller width screen makes it difficult for my aging eyes to find what I need quickly.  I would also prefer if the home screen did not have such a large day and date display.  It takes up so much room that you lose an entire row of app icons.Subsequent screens do not have that display, so you regain a row of icons.  This phone has a fingerprint reader on the back, but it does not have face recognition technology.  I do not need face recognition, so this is not a problem for me.I was concerned with how I was going to set up a non-iPhone without losing data or having to put in a great amount of effort to get my apps and data transferred.  In reality, the setup was fairly painless.  I was surprised to find that I could connect the two phones together using the included quick switch adapter and transfer almost everything over.  After turning on the Pixel, I went through the initial setup options (language, WiFi, etc.).  Next, it asked if I was transferring from an iPhone, and then walked me through the setup process.First, you connect your iPhoneâs charge cord to the iPhone and to the quick switch adapter, and connect the adapter to the Pixel.  Next, a menu asks which items you want to transfer, and after making the selections, it completes the transfer.  The setup process then took me through the normal phone setup options such as backup options, location sharing, etc..  All of my contacts, calendar items, photos, notes, messages, and many device settings copied over perfectly.For an unknown reason, only 74 of my 137 apps were transferred to the new phone.  I assume that the Pixel looks for matching apps in Google Play and, if a match is found, installs the app from there.  Most of the apps that were not copied over had a match in Google Play, so I am not certain why they didn't transfer.  Am I unhappy that I had to manually load some apps?  No!  I was quite pleased that the Pixel was able to copy over what it did from my iPhone without having to go to great lengths to load the data.I am only beginning to explore the Pixel 5 but there are a few features that I really like.  This phone is not only Qi wireless charging capable, but it also offers reverse wireless charging, which allows the Pixel to charge other phones that have wireless charging capabilities.  I was able to charge an iPhone using the Pixel.  To accomplish this, you just need to place the two phones back-to-back and the second phone will start charging.  Of course,you will consume the Pixelâs charge while doing this.I like the cameraâs capabilities.  Google is known for having good photo capability and performance, and it shows in the quality of the photos and videos that I have taken.  I like the 360 degree panorama and the photosphere capabilities.  The photosphere pictures are created by taking a series of photos in a 360 degree up and down, and side to side, manner and the Pixel 5 stitches them together to form an interactive 3D image.  The camera also has several options for camera stabilization when shooting videos.  These options are set depending on the expected movement of the camera, the subject, or both.  This option works well when, for example, I shoot a video while walking.  I like that the camera has an ultrawide lens capability.  I have often had to use the panorama mode to get everything in a picture that I wanted, but the wide-angle capability eliminates that in many situations.The overall speed and responsiveness of this phone is good.  The apps load quickly, and there is no hesitancy in their operation.  I installed a premium screen protector, and I have not experienced any issues with the touch screen's operation.  The battery lasts a long time, which I definitely appreciate.",Pixel 5
"After reading a lot of geeky reviews on YouTube and portals, I bought Oneplus7t. Pls, note I have been using OnePlus from last many years now so my expectations were clear. My experience with the device says that most of the reviews or unboxing things are influenced. Pls, note I have bought it with my own money unlike leading reviewers or unboxing video geeks who get it for free. So pls don't go by them blindly. Go for users reviews who bought them with their own money. So I am writing my 5 days experience with the phone.I am not a gamer or a geek. A regular user who wants to do all the office work on the phone, social media, blogging and vlogging, etc.The last OnePlus phone I was using was Oneplus 5 and was quite happy with it until it screen got broken and replacement cost was higher than the selling price of the device itself.The day it arrived from Amazon I opened it with a lot of excitement which continued till I have held it in my hands.Here are the issues:1. Weight: It weighed too much I felt like holding a brick. And it is thick. When I hold it in one hand for a few minutes I get a deep red pit in my hand (due to blood circulation).2. Camera: Then I had to go for a conference there I tried clicking pictures. Picture quality did not come out well. Still, I thought it may be light or background because of my previous experiences I could not believe it to be not good. So I continued clicking pictures which really missed detailing. As you zoom in it will make it blurred. I have clicked a magazine cover picture with my Oneplus 5 which had only 16 MP camera but pic quality was natural and good. It clicks blur pics may it has to do with image Stabilization.3. Battery:  Battery is avg. All those time I teased my iPhone or Samsung Series colleagues and friends for their battery life. Welcome to the league. This offers an avg battery life. I never carried a charger with me in previous models if I Start with 90% even after two years. But here I have to carry it even for the average usage. I m wondering what would be this phone battery life in a year or more.4. 90 Hz refresh rate is a gimmick to sell this device. It will give you fluid experience but the soon it consumes battery you will always prefer to keep it to 60hz which is an option given in the display settings. If you always stick to a desk or have a power source around you can keep it to 90hz. Not for people who are on the move most of the time. Don't fall for it.5. Sound: It's average. Phone calls are not crisp and clear. At times the caller's voice gets hazy and husky. Voice is even audible to person the person sitting next to me. Even on lower volumes. Speakers volume is loud but the sound quality is not good.6. No premium-feeling anymore. With multiple variants, it has joined the league of Samsung, Mi, Oppo, Vivo. Now they are launching 7t pro on Oct 10 again it is a disappointment for those who bought 7t on day 1. Maybe their R&D or trials have some problem here that in every two months they are launching a new device with an update to the previous faults. Like OnePlus 7 has voice receiver on one side which is right. So if you take calls or hear the phone from left you won't get a clear voice or volume. So they added receivers on both the side in this device.I am still not getting why I have spent Rs 40,000 on it. No camera quality, no battery life, no sound quality on calls, getting wounds on holding it for long.I have always recommended OnePlus devices to everyone around and had high hopes and trust on the brand that I bought it on the day of the launch but with this experience, I won't recommend OnePlus 7t to my colleagues and friends who are planning to upgrade their devices.",OnePlus 7T

"This phone has great performance, good camera and ambiance. Charging is fast as per the Oneplus standards set in earlier phones. What is concerning me is the heating issue which crops up off and on. The Battery drains quickly so we have to keep it at 60Hz to longer life. Is there anyone else feeling the heating issues?",OnePlus 7T
"THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST PHONE I HAVE EVER PURCHASED. PLEASE DONT BUY THIS PHONE AND PUT YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON STAKE. THERE ARE SO MANY CONS IN THIS PHONE. EARLIER I HAVE USED ONE PLUS 5T PHONE SO I KNEW WHAT TO EXPECT FROM THIS PHONE BUT THIS TIME I AM SO MUCH DISAPPOINTED.HERE ARE MY CONCERNS1. SCREEN RESOLUTION AND QUALITY OF THE SCREEN IS SO POOR. THERE IS GRAINS AND COLOR BANDING ISSUE IN SCREEN. IMAGES LOOKS GRAINY AND UNSHARP IN COMPARISION TO ONE PLUS 5T OR 6T. PHONE RATIO IS 20:9 SO INSTAGRAM IMAGES WILL BE IN SHOWN IN PORTRAIT MODE INSTEAD OF LANDSCAPE MODE. IMAGES ON THE SCREEN IS SO BLURRRY2. DESIGN OF THE PHONE IS MESS. SO MUCH CAMERA BULK. EVEN THE PROVIDED CASE CANNOT PROTECT IT FROM SCRATCHES. PHONE IS VERY FAT AND HAEVY. LENGTH IS ALSO TOO MUCH BECAUSE OF THE RATIO. ALSO THERE IS NO PREMIUM FEELING AFTER HOLDING THIS PHONE AS WAS WITH THE ONE PLUS 5T.3. 3.5MM JACK IS BIG OMMISSION SINCE ONE PLUS 6 PHONE. THERE IS NO BENEFIT OF REMOVING IT. THERE IS NO BIGGER BATTERY. ALSO YOU HAVE TO BUY A SEPERATE ADAPTER OR NEW BLUTOOTH EARPHONES AND BLUTOOTH EARPHONES QUALITY CAN NEVER BE AS GOOD AS WIRED EARPHONES.4. CAMERA QUALITY IS AVERAGE. NO INCREASE IN PICTURE QUALITY. 3 CAMERAS ARE ONLY FOR NAME SAKE.I WAS VERY HAPPY ONE PLUS CUSTOMER, BUT NOW I WON'T RECOMMEND THIS PHONE TO ANYONE. PLEASE DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY.",OnePlus 7T
No earphone jack,OnePlus 7T
"The smart Lock feature is not working on the phone. It doesn't require PIN/ fingerprint sensor sometimes. It gets unlocked by side power button which creates a big security issue. The battery back up is just pathetic. Not so great camera make is totally underserving for the kind of price OnePlus is selling this device. If option available, I would have asked for refund.",OnePlus 7T
Amazing phone.. and charging is awesome.. 0 to 100 in just 51 min,OnePlus 7T
"Very worst on speed. hanging and not responding at all. Got mobile day before yesterday on 2nd Oct and installed only basic apps like whatsapp, fb, banking apps and no movies or any other images or music loaded but still it is hanging.Now the clock is not working and the alarm is not ringing which is a very basic feature",OnePlus 7T
"Firstly, I didn't receive my headset. It's mentioned on Amazon website that the customers will get a free headset in the box.This is like misleading the customers by giving false information.Secondly, I want to say. I like everything about this phone. This is my first Oneplus phone and I love Oxygen OS.Having said that, I'm facing some minor heating issues with my phone. It's on and off but it still bothers me. Didn't expect it would happen with Oneplus. Hope this can be fixed. Had heard a lot about OnePlus so, when I decided to purchase a new phone I picked OnePlus 7T over ROG 2.Battery is decent. Does not drain out quickly. Using dark mode helps a lot in saving battery even after heavy usage.I don't like the camera of this phone. When you use beauty mode it entirely changes your face and you look really weird. Samsung, Oppo, Vivo are far better when it comes to camera. Wide angle photos also come out odd. When you click objects using wide angle they come out well. But, when you click photos of people the person in the front comes out really bad. Especially with the selfie camera. This phone has the worse selfie camera.I was earlier using Samsung S7 Edge which was much smaller compared to OnePlus 7T. This phone is big. So, it will take some time for me to get adjusted to this phone.",OnePlus 7T

"Was sceptical when watched reviews that it gives OnePlus 7pro a run for it's money. But having using since last 4days. I am assured that it does give OnePlus 7pro, Samsung S10 and even Iphone 11 a run for the money.Interface- I used MIUI, EMIUI, amigo os, but none of those were never smooth as Oxygen OS. It's super fluid and killing fast (credit also goes to SD855+ and 8gb ram).Camera- One of the best under 50k that's the only thing I can say.Built Quality- On par with other premium smartphonesDisplay- Have used LCD panel display phones for entire life. So yes, really enjoying watching videos. (And to make the things more sweeter Stereo Speakers on the phone)Verdict- If you can spend 3-4k more than OnePlus 7. Then do it. It will be worth it.",OnePlus 7T

   This is my second device after replacement of the firstly bought OnePlus 7T , first time i got a defective product and the issue was battery draining. Although the OnePlus 7T has battery draining issue but the one I had was so rapid in battery draining. So within the return period i requested for a refund but Amazon denied and only issued for a  replacement. I tried my best calling customer support but they were so rude and never accepted my refund request. So i got my replacement. When coming to this replaced device , this is the one having lot of problems than the first one especially the main feature like camera. Front cam is not working at all and OnePlus claims that they have better software but the phone is very lag at some point and some apps might also get crashed while in use. I fed up with this device and for my bad luck i opened the box after return date because i was busy with exams. So they denied my replacement request by saying the return window has closed and asked me to contact OnePlus. I contacted OnePlus they also repeated the same they can't help me by replacing only they could do is to repair my newly bought phone. Is it fair enough from Amazon or OnePlus side to repair a newly bought phone and especially the one having inbuilt hardware issue? So without any option i went to Kochi service centre for repairing , they checked my phone and they told that it's just a software issue and told me to come after some hours. So i came after some hours and they did something with my phone and gave it back , then i checked infront of them . Very unfortunate from their side so i burst in to anger because when i opened the front cam still it's not functioning. So without even checking the condition of the phone they gave it back. So probably what would we do? This is my experience from Amazon and OnePlus side , so you decide before buying this phone. Worst phone and worst service from Amazon and OnePlus side. I'm just a student and with all my savings i bought this dream phone but it became my nightmare.Nothing more to be added about this phone in all departments it sucks.Please don't buy it from Amazon and if you have any other option go for another brand.",OnePlus 7T

"Update 2: currently on 10.3.4 and after almost a year the device is still going strong. No signs of slowing down or any kind of performance deterioration. Last geekbench 5 score was same as the day I got it, which means oxygen os is still optimized perfectly. Only drawback for this device is fingerprint reader which slowly starts to forget your fingers and doesnt recognize them if you have more than 2 fingers enrolled.Update 1: just got the new update to oxygen OS 10.0.3 and the issues with the gaming mode are gone....Been using this for 2 days now and let me say this first this is a great device and I am really really glad I bought this and not Samsung Note 10. Now here is my review broken down in Pros and Cons list.Pros:Comes with pre-applied screen guard and a transparent silicon case in the box.As always Cable quality is great and Charger is well built.Display quality is great and as in the spec sheet it is a HDR10+ certified display which provides gorgeous colors and great viewing experience.In-Hand feel is also great, the device has a weight to it that doesn't make it too heavy or to light to use.The back glass is slippery but not as slippery as previous OnePlus devices.I have big hands so I can easily reach the far corners for gesture navigation.Performance is just top notch. I haven't used any device till now that can surpass the fluidity of this device. Everything feels so natural and seamless.The 90Hz display is just great and adds to the faster experience of the device.Speakers are not as good as the ASUS ROG Phone 2 or the iPhone XS PRO MAX but they are great for the price range and may be equal to Samsung Note series.Call quality is great on JIO and Vodafone networks, Mic also performs a great job in cancelling the ambient noise so the other party can hear your voice clearly in both loudspeaker and normal modes.Charging speeds are great too. Got the device fully charged from 15% tot 100% in just and hour and that is great.The new Android 10  with Oxygen OS is great and fluid as I said earlier but there are still some bugs to be fixed by the OnePlus team.The front camera is great for casual selfies in ample light situations but in low light the software is not yet optimized yet.The same goes for the triple camera setup at the back. It is a good camera but can be made better using the software. In a lot of light the pictures comes great but sometimes the colors are faded out. in Low light there is a bit much noise for my liking and same goes for the Macro shots.Battery life is great and I am constantly getting around 5hr of screen on time with my average to above average usage of the device.Cons:Hardware wise there are no cons in the device but software wise there are a bit of bugs and much needed improvement.There is a bug whenever I open a Game or any graphics intensive app the screen first goes to black and then O have to lock the device and unlock it again using the face unlock to get to the game screen.The Camera software is not optimized yet.Battery life can be an issue for some users.The Navigation gestures are the worst to ever grace the Android Screen. They are slow, Clumsy and needs a lot of getting use-to by someone who is coming from the older OnePlus gestures. Not to mention the issues I feel while using the Back gesture with the tall side ridges in the provided case. I have to literally put pressure on the thumb to dig into the edge of the display and the ridge of the case to get it working every-time and now I have switched back to older 3 button navigation.",OnePlus 7T
No more function.When call from second sim first sim net disconnectedNot daily data usage option.Cheap phone. I really hurt after buy this company phone,OnePlus 7T
Pros:Design looks sleek and easy to handle though it's a big screen. Well balanced in the hand. My 3T feels a little heavy though there is not much of a weight difference.Good Speed and performance.Very good display.Excellent cameras. Definitely a big change from previous models.Cons:Still in the process of experiencing the product. Will update based on my findings.,OnePlus 7T
"Nice phone...Camera superb, Battery great and ideal premium phone at such an affordable price",OnePlus 7T
Everything is fine .. but the slow-motion doesn't work properly it should start with normal speed then slow and then end with speed..but it's not at all good..it's awful..if you click 2 sec of video the phone will convert it to 30sec with very low speed and it's boring not similar as iPhone or any other phone..I just want to know it's with my phone or you guys are facing the same problem,OnePlus 7T
Battery life sucks!It drains completely in less than 5 hours after countinous usage.Iphone 11 gives about 10 hours of SOT even after having a small battery.Think before you purchase.I want OnePlus and Amazon to fix this as soon as they can otherwise this phone would get negative remarks just for its battery. Otherwise everything else is fine with this phone. OnePlus needs to optimise the phone!,OnePlus 7T
Heating and battery drains very quickly. If battery life is not good then fast charging does not matters. No support from one plus customer care. Camera is fake. Portarit mode is very poor quality. I just want to tell the customers that oneplus is cheating its customers. Desperately wants to return this phone.,OnePlus 7T
"I got the phone on Monday, from that day onward Mobile is showing downloading downloading... whereas it was not opening the Play store or i can't update any app onto the phone. Internet connectivity shows very slow. When i checked with my old phone it was downloading the app with in few second, whereas this phone show downloading more than 1hr.  I am not happy the way mobile is functioning. I think there is an software issue into this phone.

"Ok so I am using this device from 3 days. Here is my review. I bought this phone after using iPhone 7 plus and Vivo NEX. Everyone here is writing about pros. But I will write about cons.1. UI - there are too many issues with software. For example it has gesture navigation option. But trust me. Its use less. You will be back to old school navigation key after few hours. Every one use mobile case these days. And it is very hard to use those gestures with case on. Also it conflicts with many apps. You will not be able to open menu of any app due to these gestures. Vivo nex has this feature but they implemented it very well.2. Battery - It has only 3800mAh battery. You may have watched many videos it is enough for 5-6 hours. Trust me it's not. I am getting only 4- hours SOT with very normal uses. Update - I lost 2% battery while writing this review.3. Charging - Oneplus says it support 30W charger. So let me come to reality. I Compared this phone with my old vivo nex. And I found 7t charges at maximum 3450mA (checked with Ampare app). And Vivo nex with has 23.5W charger charges at 4100mA. Don't know why any YouTube didn't mentioned it.4. Camera - The thing I liked about camera is just macro mode. Every thing else is still below average in this price range. Front camera and portrait mode is even worse than my 3 year old iPhone 7 plus.Fingerprint, facescanner and performance is perfect.",OnePlus 7T

Bad phone... What's app hang....And nobody listening nor OnePlus care neither Amazon for replacement. Care telling third party app we are not responsible....,OnePlus 7T
"It's always a good idea to research about the issues of a phone before buying. In this case, oneplus 7t suffers from a green tint issue in display. It's only noticeable when there is some gray colored app(which is most apps with dark theme) like dark theme of youtube, chrome in incognito mode etc and below 50% brightness. Just google and ""green tint issue oneplus 7t"" and you'll find plenty of images and experiences. This only happens with a batch of product and it's possible yours doesn't have this issue so make sure you check this first thing when you get the phone in a dark room. Apart from this, the phone is really good but sadly this issue made me return the device because even the replacement was facing the same issue.",OnePlus 7T
"==== A lengthy & brutally honest review. It's worth the read if you plan on purchasing this device. ====I am a Design Specialist by Profession & also into Mobile Photography, hence I was hooked in using the Pixel 2XL. This phone is a worthy upgrade if you're transitioning from Galaxy S9 / Pixel 1 or 2 series / OnePlus 6, 6T & below / iPhone X or 7 and below.OnePlus 7T Pro is only an incremental upgrade over it's predecessor OnePlus 7 Pro.===== What has been improved over the 7 Pro? ====+ Faster Processor. Snapdragon 855 Plus.+ Adreno 640. Better Gaming Performance.+ Better Haptic Motor. Same as the 7T.+ Fast Charging. Warp 30T Technology.+ Brighter Nits (Upto 1000 compared to 800 of 7 Pro)+ Super Macro Mode, Night reading Modes, Android 10 out of the box, Better Nightscape 2.0. These software updates will be eventually updated for the 7 Pro as well.==== What's in the Box? ====OnePlus 7T Pro Device.User Manual.Transparent Silicon Case.SIM Ejector Tool.Warp 30T Charging Brick.Type C USB Cable.And some cool OnePlus Stickers.==== Display ====Firstly, OnePlus 7T Pro has a stunning display over its predecessors. I'm personally not a fan of notches nor do I click a lot of selfies, so I prefer the OnePlus 7T Pro's Fluid Display. Feels more luxurious over the 7T. It's marginally bigger to hold as well. I would recommend using a case so that the edges don't feel slippery. However, you should also note that in different lighting conditions, 7T Pro has glares at the curves due to the rounder corners which I believe is negligible. 90Hz is smoooooth. You would never want to get back to 60Hz once you're used to this.==== Performance ====Snapdragon 855 Plus is one of the best CPUs out there (at the time of writing this review) and with Adrena 640, it takes gaming and multi-tasking to another league. COD & PUB-G juices out at their best with 60FPS & is indeed smooth than imagined. 855 Plus is at par with the A13 Bionic from Apple. Haven't experienced any drops in frames. RAM Management is splendid & 8GB RAM is recommended unless you want to get the 12 Gig McLaren Edition to save on a few seconds everyday.==== Camera ====I honestly have to admit that it's not the best out there as I was expecting a leap from it's predecessors. It still uses the Sony IMX 586 (48 MP) for it's main sensor and it's Telephoto at 2.2X optical (3X lossless) and is at par with iPhone. But when compared with the GCam Mod, the OnePlus Camera seems to have improved a lot from it's previous versions. The Wide Angle is fairly okayish with some distortions being present at the edges. Nightscape is now available for Wide Angle shots too.==== Video ====If you're into Video Recording, then be a bit disappointed to hear this as it isn't the best while it can still take average videos without much shake utilizing the OIS and EIS at 1080P and just OIS at 4K 60FPS. It still doesn't shoot 4K in wide angle. Apple iPhone 11 takes the lead here. OIS and EIS combined together has a lot of warping and rolling shutter which is a turn off for video producers. It's still not an alternate for a Gimbal. The videos look oversaturated too which can be fixed by shooting on a Third Party app like Filmic Pro.==== Software ====This is one of the biggest features for you to switch to the OnePlus. Stock Android was butter smooth while I missed out on a lot of simple gestures like Longer Screenshots, Silence Button, Customized Navigational elements & much more which lacked on the Stock OS from Google. I would say Oxygen OS should be set as a benchmark for Google to include these incremental features on their upcoming flagships. Oxygen OS has presently the best OS Experience for Android.==== Battery ====Warp T30 is super fast. It helps you charge from 0-100 in lesser time than an episode on Netflix. Although not the fastest charger in the industry, it still gets through a day on heavy usage.==== What could've been improved ====- Minor improvements on Camera.- No ToF sensor- No Wireless Charging.- IP Rating.- Better silicon case should be included in their future upgrades.==== Verdict ====No doubt that the ASUS Fans would recommend the ROG 2. ROG 2 is hands down the best gaming phone with 120 HZ Display but lacks majorly on other aspects like software updates, Telephoto Camera, Splash Proof, Build Quality and security patches which are very essential for business professionals or regular consumers. ASUS is also not known to provide regular updates to it's consumers over the OnePlus which has a closely knit community among the developers and has more Brand Value than ASUS & nevertheless to mention that the OnePlus 7T Pro feels premium out of the box.If you're planning to upgrade from a device almost 2 years old then this would be the best upgrade in case you require a phone with no-notch and curved screen. 7T Pro feels very slippery when compared to the 7T. I wish they made smaller devices. Otherwise I would still recommend the 7T which is the best bang for your buck.If you still wish to own this but cannot afford the extra rupee on incremental updates (Fast Charging, 855 Plus) , my suggestion would be is to go for the OnePlus 7 Pro. It's still one of the best devices out there.",OnePlus 7T Pro
"I think I am the first one to write a review for this beauty :)  I ordered this at 11 PM in the night and It was there in my hand in the morning 9 AM.I have used iPhone X, Samsung s9 plus and Samsung s10 plus before coming to One Plus 7T.  My experience so far with this:1. Display: It's amazing. Sharpness, brightness and 90Hz displays makes it one of the most beautiful displays.2. Camera: All of my previous mobiles had great cameras. 7t Pro is nothing less than that. If you are a professional photographer, you might find differences. For a normal user, it's just perfect.3. Battery: I am getting a very good battery backup. When I go to bed, it's 30%. 30T Warp charger is a booom.4. Performance: Blazing and Lightning fast.5. One of the USP of OnePlus mobiles is its Oxygen OS. After using iPhone and Samsungs One UI, I can tell you that it's the best. Lots of gestures, shortcuts and very lightweight.The only Con I think it has is its weight. It's on the heavier side but after using it for few days now, I am getting used to it.Go for it guys !! You won't regret.",OnePlus 7T Pro
"Its fastest phone that I have ever experienced. There are no hiccups, none what so ever. Overall smooth experience between switching apps and regular functions.The Display is to die for.Magnificent Macro mode and Night mode  in camera.There is just nothing wrong with it.Overall an overwhelming experience.Call of Duty runs flawlessly ...The phone is so fast it takes some getting used to.Charging speed as advertised.No Complaints.",OnePlus 7T Pro
"Hi, When I open my this most awaited phone, I just saw 2 major Draw Back1st. The Camera Quality, Dear One Plus maker if we paid you 54000.00 (53999.00) then why we compromise with today's main features the CAMERA.The zoom quality is very poor, pic are RIP-UP,DURING ZOOM SHOT OR WHEN YOU SEE THE CAPTURED IMAGE WITH ZOOM.NIGHT PHOTOGRAPHY AND SHOT IS ALSO POORIN NIGHT PICTURES YOU SAW LOTS OF DOTS- RIP-UP.IMAGE NOT CAPTURED IN HIS ORIGINAL COLOR.THERE ARE LOTS OF ISSUES WITH CAMERA QUALITY.SO THINK ABOUT YOUR USERS AND GIVE A BEST QUALITY.Hope ONE PLUS Team look and work on it and solve this issue in his next software updates.Dear Amazon team pass this feedback to ONE PLUS TEAM.",OnePlus 7T Pro
"Amazing phone with an unbelievably smooth and vivid display.I had been using the OnePlus 5T before and a big fan of OnePlus cameras and OS.But I've always felt the OnePlus display wasn't good enough.This mobile just killed that thought.Highlights:1)Buttery smooth, fast and bright display -The edge display is just wowwww. You just can't stop admiring it.2)Excellent camera - The pictures come out so well in all kinds of lighting and modes.  *Portrait*- The new zoom mode in portrait is just wow.Looks exactly like DSLR clicks.  Macro - I love taking closeup shots of flowers and patterns and with this...you can get as close as 2.5 cms and click amazing shots.  Nightscape - This area is a huge upgrade compared to my OnePlus 5t.You get crisp and clear pictures without any noise.The pictures are now to the mark of Pixel mobiles.  Popup camera - If you are hesitant or doubtful about popup cameras...I am telling you there is nothing to worry...It is Soo smooth and quick that you never will notice it is a hardware controlled camera.Selfies have never been this better.Bright and sharp shots anytime.  Video - Haven't really used much.Will update later3)Dolby speakers - Excellent sound quality with awesome stereo effect.Once again a huge upgrade over the older models.4)90 Hz refresh rate - Yes this one gives you a totally different experience when using your mobile.It is clearly faster and better than the usual 60Hz displays.5)Build and design - Just perfect...It's sleek...stylish and neat. Loved the camera setup in OnePlus 7T but hated the circular bump.And I totally loved the edge display in OnePlus 7 pro.This device is just a perfect combination of the best features in the 7t and the 7pro and NOT an unwanted model like everyone is claiming.6) Batter and charging - The charging is blazing fast and the battery very easily lasts a whole day,even with 90Hz refresh rate.",OnePlus 7T Pro

   I was really happy to have this phone, switching from apple to android. The phone is really big and has lot of power in it, no problem in playing games, its like silk smooth games, navigation between apps, super fast. All updates were done for software and apps. I am in love with it.... ButAfter 2 days of normal usage and random navigation on the device. The device started rebooting itself, I was shocked but thought maybe just after reboot it will ok. But it rebooted for 3 hours continuously without any stop, till the whole battery got drained. I was not able to perform any action, it made me handicapped for 3 hours, where I cannot do anything...

Phone is great. Everything is good.But I have one doubt. I got acko screen protection for 1 year.But Amazon didn't mention about this acko screen protection offer.Do anyone got too?,OnePlus 7T Pro
"No 3.5 headphone jack(Phone is thicker than 3.5 and there's plenty of space). No 3.5/C adapter provided in box. Never settle? No official adapter sold in Amazon either. You have to get registered on their website. Why?!Display seems to have a bit of yellow tint. Although fast, not really seeing the so called magic of 90Hz display. Overhyped. Curved edges make reading a bit weird: Lines go up from the left (curve on the left), then flat in the middle and then go down on the right(curve on the right)- Wish the OS provided a margin on both edges,if needed.",OnePlus 7T Pro
"Being one of the first people getting their hands on the New Oneplus 7T pro sounds amazing.... But after using for a day this is what I found. ..Cons :1) Heats up quickly2) If on a video call ( whatsapp)  unable to use whatsapp properly getting hung it screen frozen3) Battery drains out a bit fast. In 15 hours battery came from 100% to 35 % off which I slept for 8 hours with Wi-Fi and internet on.4) The set is very slippery, you will need a case.5) I assume there is a bug which keeps going to the main menu when I'm trying to surf any app.Pros :1) Amazing Camera2) Very fast battery charging.3) The case that comes with the package is very rubbery and not hard but it has a very good grip.4) Handset already comes with a screen guard.5) The screen display is one of the best.6) Very fast processor. And able to open simultaneous apps without compromising speed and performance.I hope this has helped ppl..  I will get some more reviews once I use this set more.  Cheers.  As a whole buy this for the experience. Or you can just wait for the Mclaren edition of you like a darker and more Ram speed.  Else I would say go for it.  The bugs will be definitely removed woth the next update. I hoping..  For the to me being I would give it a3.5/5Ranjan Ghosh (RON)",OnePlus 7T Pro

Disappointed with amazon and oneplus. Got a defective product with defective type c port. Official type c to 3.5 mm jack converter is not working. Oneplus service center said problem with type c port. And device need to be opened to replace the port. If some other problem arises since they opened the device after warranty then I need to spend out of my pocket to service it. Amazon pointing oneplus and one plus pointing Amazon. Nice way of doing business guys. Charge a premium money. Send defective product. Correct the defect since it is in warranty. Let some other defect arise after warenty. Loot money from the customer in the name of service charge.,OnePlus 7T Pro
"Earlier I was one plus 5T That time i 100% Satisfied  ,That was last one plus member i have been used after that I bought Note 9(Samsung) which was another incredible Phone in my life but after after 2 month I sold that mobile reason was1: Big Size (Not Fit in Pocket)2: Battery was big but drainage was too fast.So the next mobile came in my life was iPhone xs max (256 gb)Guys that was another beast but but ..........again my daily life suffering with few problem which might be small for other but big for me.1: Two whatsapp (reguler and business) was not on iphone2: IRCTC official app was not there.3 : Really not easy to assess my iphone file and documents on laptop (Hp)So finally i decided to change my iphone to another android device that is ONE PLUS 7T pro.Few more mobile was in my mind which was1: Ascus ROG 22:Samsung  S10 Plus3:OP 7T4: Upcoming pixel 4But i choosen OP 7T Pro Why?During usage of last few mobile i was really missing fast charging like i was having OP 5TWhy i left above phone Because1:Ascus rog is bit heavy and not for daily usage also not available since long due to out of stock.2:Samsung is ,hhhmmm  same phone what i left with note 9 and  S10+ is bit older for now if i am going to invest money.3: OP 7T is Old Design (according to me) also I really bored with NOTCH..NOTCH GAME4: Google really not Made Pixel4 what i expected specially front Design.again big border line design.Sooooooo Now using OP 7T Pro ,Points Are1: Battery , yes not great but not bad as critics are giving their review.good for Daily usage. Just understand guys OP can give us bigger 5K -6K Battery  but not making such big battery phone ,reson behind this was that More Big Battery really take much more time than what we expected from OP.Also 4085 MAH is sufficient ,really good for Daily need .2 Days battery life are just bluff even 6K MAH battery ROG is not giving 2 Days battery backup.2:Display : Great ! The highlighted point what i fall upon on OP7T Pro is its Display .tooooo Saxy and amaze to experience.3:Fast Charging : I think this is the reply if any one asking for big battery.I am Travelling centric person ,suppose i visited any of my clients/Place for 30 Min in a day so i can get my phone charged for 60-70% immediately that no phonce can perform like that.So understand All new Develop 30T Wrap Charger is biggest Pro of OP 7T Pro. Tooooo fast.4:No Notch : Even in Latest Iphone having ugly notch believ me phone not having notch looking more beautiful that any notch phone.Especially when you watching videos or Doing any excel work.5: Ultra fast Oxigen OS: feel i using Stock android experience.So no Discussion for this.6:855+ Snap Dragon : Don't be hype but it's is similer A13 Chip.Only in few matter A13 won like vedio randering etc which 99% People don't needed.7: good network Reception :Yes ,I was blindly believe that Samsung Mobile having (S10+) best network Reception in industry but first time OP performance is really amazing.8:Voice Quality:Similer to iphone so no complain.9Vibration Motor: I still give 1st Rank to Apple devices  because vibration lavel of any iphone is best in industry but this time OP did somthing amazing with their devices OP 7T pro having different motor which is 90%Similer to Iphone.10:Camera : frankly says here i feel compromise because earlier i was having XS max iphone which was far ahead than this device ,yes micro mode is something exiting for me.CON :1: Big Phone :So before making any decisions just understand this is a BIG phone2: Sleepery Design : if you are a person that using phone while driving (2 Wheelers), putting in halmet while biking so this will not fullfill your requirements because of it Saxy design. This is the phone where in office meeting you can put on table afore all employees and showoff.3: Nothing More just one request /Suggestions to OP that stay on your previous policy to launch single device in a year.My few friends bought OP 7 pro just 3 month Ago and now OP launches these 2 phones 7T and 7T pro.Now Maclaren.....So OP we indian belief on brands so don't changes policy that customer felt they cheated.So Guys this is my all details on this device and my prior devises.hope you all enjoyed to take this before going to expens your bucks.",OnePlus 7T Pro
"Thos phone is a beast in itself, was worth my wait.Battery is still less for the specifications this monster of a phone embraces but the you have warp30t in the house.Worth a purchase.",OnePlus 7T Pro
"This is a detailed review of OnePlus 7T Pro and I'll explain if it's worth buying in 2020.This phone was released in October 2019..and I bought this device in 2020 because most of the specs are still worth paying money for.Camera :- 4.5/5Battery :- 4.5/5Display :- 5/5 ( Qhd + 90Hz Amazing )In 2020 even though OnePlus launched it's 8 series..we already saw 8 Pro having serious issues.Talking about OnePlus 8 , it is the base model in the 8 Series..with SD 865 the latest one .. but Last year's 855+ in 7T Pro is never too behind compared to the performance offered.If talking about camera I'll blindly choose the 7T pro over 8 , macro lens with 2 MP in OP 8 is of no use...where at the same time we are able to shoot close up pics in 7T pro with the Software based Macro mode...which offers more detailed images than the OP 8 .Battery is slightly larger in 8 4300 mAh compared to 4085 in 7T pro...still not a big difference..My OP 7T pro easily gets me through a full day with moderate use...when we have a 30 watt charger it's not a case to worry about anyway...it charges 0-100 in about 1 hour 10 minutes (Tested).Gaming ... games will run in high settings... PUBG and COD mobile...tested and it's awesome.Display OnePlus 8 and 7T pro has 90 Hz displayWhere 8 comes with FHD+ resolution while 7T pro comes with QHD Resolution...If u need Better Camera and Display go for 7T proIf u need the latest processor and slightly bigger battery go for OnePlus 8 .7T Pro was last year's Flagship while 8 is the base model.So obviously 7T pro is worth buying in 2020..Trust me whoever is confused which OnePlus to buy...Go for it..I don't think we need to compare it with iPhone SEð..",OnePlus 7T Pro

Warp charger fulls battery in 1hr from 0 to 100.5.smooth and fast. Coming from LG G6 definitely feels an upgradeCon1.camera is awful, both front(motorized is one of the downside) and back. Macro mode is fun to play with. My old LG G6 takes good pics that this2.feels heavy when used for long time.3.no use of edge screen as Samsung does with their own4. Fingerprint reader is hit and miss.5. Slippery and feels delicate6. Headset or 3.5mm adapter should have included in boxIf you are confuse between op7t and this phone then only screen is deciding point.Hopefully gcam will improve main weak point of this phone",OnePlus 7T Pro
"Fabulous phone really. The display is amazing. The full screen without bezels looks vibrant and very attractive. The built in quality is very good. This is actually a bit heavy than is expected, gives that premium feel. Screen is super responsive and as the refreshment rate is 90 Hz, this is very fast. The 8GB ram is more than enough. Gaming is also excellent.The battery is giving easy full day in a single charge and the charging is super quick. Overall a brilliant phone.The Camera is also very good. Both rare and front cameras are up to the mark. You can always use that Pro mode to get the best of this camera.",OnePlus 7T Pro
"I am an average smartphone user. Don't have time to play games etc. I got interested in this set given its specifications and deep discount since it's last year's model. The set that was delivered was dead on arrival but Amazon sent me a replacement in 2 days. This set works flawlessly and is simply a charm to use. The build is superb, oxygen OS is very nice and fast( my earlier phone Mi A2 ran stock Android). Also I loved the font and the default SMS functionalities. These are small things but these details matter. The camera is very nice. I know some people have complained about the camera. Believe me, its great. Does it struggle in very low light? Of course it does. But so does most DSLR. I have a Nikon D5100 and I have faced weird white balance issues with it for long in night shots. Some people will say iPhones are better in this respect. Again, I had an iPhone and a MacBook Pro and they both stopped working in less than 2 years time. Never faced such issues with Android or Windows devices (my PC is 11 years old now).Among other things the on screen fingerprint reader works nicely. Didn't have any problems there. The speakers are great with very premium sound from the HD audio streaming services.The battery works well. Lasts 1.5 days for me with 60 hz. refresh rate. For my use (basic browsing, some streaming, audio books and music) 60 Hz works great. For games 90 hz maybe better. The warp charger works like a charm and provides superfast charging.I had originally planned to get pixel 4a but then decided against it after the stocks for sold in half an hour. I neither have the time, nor the energy to chase a sale event. But based on what I saw, the pixel 4a seems average in every department other than camera where it shines very brightly. OP 7T pro seems to shine almost everywhere, maybe a tad less in very low light photography. But how many such situations do you face? I am at least way more likely to listen to a song on speaker from Amazon music. On the photography department also ultrawide lens is a great addition. Who hasn't seen a photographer keep walking back to get more in frame? The 3x telephoto lens is great as well. I believe the latest 8T series doesn't have this one.All in all, for 32K (after exchange and card discount) this is probably the best well rounded phone out there right now. Go for it without second thought.",OnePlus 7T Pro
"This phone excels other phones (even those with double the price) in many aspects.The screen is just unmatchable. Forget about specs, just watch a 4K video on YouTube and you will understand.The charging is super fast. I just charged my phone from 20% to full charge in 30 minutes.The selfie camera is top notch. Better than iPhone 11 Pro Max. The back camera has a macro mode also, so if you're into that kind of photography, it's a plus.The audio is super loud and the quality is also not that bad. So if you are hesitant to buy cheap speakers, this is the deal.Add to that the 90Hz refresh rate. You won't notice this after switching to this phone, but you definitely cannot go back to a 60Hz after using this.The only thing that could have been better is the battery life. It's not bad by any means, but the 90Hz refresh eats up the battery more than expected. You can also switch to 60Hz if needed.",OnePlus 7T Pro
1.  Camera app hanging and does not open. It open after restart mobile. Sometimes hang while opening notification while playing videos. 2. Camera not worth of price.. photos gets blurry sometimes and also when you take shot with 3 cams photos gets blurr when zoom in.. I feel bad about this.. nothing changes after 2 updates..3.mobile heating up while gaming online video playing..4. Still front facing camera struggle in night photography after system update..OP you have too resolve these problems otherwise fans can get hate to these phones..5. Need to improve performance means network issue while playing online gaming ( for downloading it gets speed in mbs and for gaming doesn't get speed games getting lags),OnePlus 7T Pro
I got this product and from the time i am using it. It has no such difference from oneplus 7 pro.It's just a 855 plus  and 7 pro has 855 Snapdragon. This is the only difference this 2 phone has.I don't know about other using this product. But my phone has a heating issue.While surfing the cpu goes around 56 degree Celsius and while playing games like PubG for 30 mins and it goes 68 degree Celsius.You can't even keep  phone in your after this..Such a bad upgrade my oneplus.,OnePlus 7T Pro
"I had my doubts when purchasing a phone in October 2020, that came out in October 2019. After purchase, very happy with the decision. Buying anything else at this price would have been a mistake.Cost- Got it for around 41k during October 2020...price was 44k and added sbi debit emi offer. Exchanged my old phone to get additional 6k off. Getting a 2019 flagship,worth 54k at launch, at 35k after a year was sweet.Seller- darshita electronics took their sweet time 5-6 days to deliver it. But the security measures, oto and all for high value purchases was good.Coming to the phone-Cons first- only 1. Battery life is average. Not terrible, or bad, but average. However, if you run this at 60 hz(I can't tell the difference between 60 and 90, even after I tried); battery comfortably lasts a day..to 1.5 days. Do note that the charging is superfast....I think it fills up from 5% to 100% in 40 mins.Now the pros-Camera- elephant in the room. I was a little worried from the reviews, but pleasantly surprised when I got the device. The camera seemed great, and after the update, the camera is a flagship feature. Main shooter is awesome with vibrant colours. Wide angle lens is also good. The main reason to buy this over the 8 and 8T is the telephoto lens, which makes a world of difference in zoomed in pictures. The selfie camera is also pretty good and wide. Oh, and it's a pop-up, meaning you get a seamless full screen display. The pop-up mechanism is great, face unlock works little slower than 8 series I guess, but you do get added security, that no app can spy on you.Display- OMG. This is the phone's true highlight. The display quality, colors and brightness are amazing. You can comfortably see stuff in direct sunlight. Colours pop out magnificently. Much better than the OnePlus 8 series in this regard since I cannot stand the hole punch, or the waterdrop notch of 7T. The curved screen is awesome too. Oh, and it's quad hd! Meaning better than OnePlus 8 and 8T, and the s20 fe.Performance- it has a Snapdragon 855+.... You won't see any difference from 865. 8 gb ram and 265 gb ufs 3.0 storage makes the device lightning fast. OnePlus devices are always fast and snappy, and you cannot expect anything else from the 7T pro model.Design- the haze blue is just gorgeous. Love the finish on the back. Front is a full-screen awesome display. Gorilla glass 6 on front, 5 on back means you can comfortably use it without a cover. Comes with a transparent case, and pre-applied screen protector anyway. Looks and feels really premium, especially with the laser autofocus cutout in the back, the screen and the Matt blue finish.Miscellaneous- no IP67 certification, but OnePlus has made videos dropping it into water. YouTubers also tested it, and it's water resistant to a good degree.No wireless charging- couldn't care less as that's a poor piece of tech. You gotta keep it on a surface without moving it, charges slower compared to wired, and bad for your battery. If anything I'm glad to not have that feature.Competition- I was looking forward to Samsung s20 fe, but it's Indian variant has Exynos 990, which is horseshit. I would say if you want 5g, you can go for 8 or 8T, but you'll be giving up the telephoto lens, the full screen display, the quad hd display, and the 256 gb storage on the same price point. 8T does have a better battery though. I expect at least 2-3 years before 5g becomes common in india. At this price point, I couldn't really get a better phone for my needs. Get this if you want the best display, performance, and top level camera.",OnePlus 7T Pro
"I bought this I phone on last week and it is delivered on time. Thanks to Amazon.After I bought I came to know that I made a big mistake buying 7t pro because I didn't find a big difference than 7 pro. Only for two differences I have paid 11k extra which is not worth.Two differences are battery slightly big and snapdragon 55plusI request you guys if are planning to buy this phone pls do not go for it instead you have same feature and feel in OnePlus 7 pro.I am big fan of one plus and I will , but thought of write some economically helpful review to all of you.If you want research more on the comparison and buy.This the biggest mistake I did. I am regretting that I have wasted 11k more in which I would have bought all other gadgets for me.Finally, performance is Very nice of OnePlus 7t pro.no doubt. Only price is the concern.Thanks to all.",OnePlus 7T Pro
"I bought the OnePlus 7t pro as an upgrade to my OnePlus 6t, and I must say it is indeed a hell of an upgrade, I got it in a limited time deal of 43999 and combined with my exchange offer in which my OnePlus 6t went for 15k...got it in a steal deal...The biggest upgrade here I see is the display ad well as enhanced performance, 90hz is a whole different story and experience,at a time of quad cameras ibopted to go for triple cam setup...could have gone for 8 or 8 pro...or could have waited for the 8t series...but weighing the pros and cons along with my impatience...below are the reasons for me to buy op7tpro:1. Decreased price, released at 54k,I got it for 27k approx with exchange.2. Not a big fan of cameras or selfies, but still loved the camera of op7tpro.3. Op8 ,didn't like the design and op8 pro is unnecessarily expensive with an extra useless hardware cam called photochrom color filter4. Not much different between Snapdragon 855plus and 865.5. Really like the popup camera, added security for hackers or spies.6. End to end screen.7. Always better to buy the exact lower version of product as soon as a new product is released, you will get the actual value product at almost half the price, never target the latest release, as you will be bored of it and will be willing to upgrade it in a year or a half, by that time new products of the same brand will be available.Op7tpro is an amazing phone in terms of display, performance, battery, processor, camera and overall build quality...op8 and op8pro open apps just a few microseconds faster, 120hz and 90 hz difference is not even visible much to naked eyes....so going for 8 or 8pro seemed a big overkill to spend 20k more....the op 7tpro can still kill the big boys going to be released in 2021 , 22 and 23 too.... Very happy with purchase, wild definitely recommend.... Meet the speed... Never settle",OnePlus 7T Pro
1. Battery drains little quick2. Camera quality is not as per expectations and even the quality of pics captured does not meets the satisfaction level..3. Rest is still under observation.,OnePlus 7T Pro
I am using this mobile since couple of days and it is satisfying me with all it's great features. I will suggest everyone go for it without thinking much.I was probably thinking to buy OnePlus 7T or 7T Pro but in 7T you will face some draining battery issue as it has 3800 my but you will not face those issue in 7T pro. And it's just superb in it's all features.I will suggest go for it without thinking much.,OnePlus 7T Pro
Awesome product,OnePlus 7T Pro
"I bought just before 20 days ago, and today i got Android 10.5 update and i updated it.After i that found my mobile got damaged it upper right corner black.Please help me through this issue or replace the mobile as soon as possible.",OnePlus 7T Pro
"OnePlus 7t pro remains the best phone to offer an uninterrupted, immersive full screen experience without any obnoxious notch or punchhole. I have been a OnePlus 6 owner and a fan of Oxygen OS ever since. Would have gone with OnePlus 8 pro if they would have retained the popup camera. OnePlus is consistent with software updates and Oxygen OS is even better than Stock Android in my opinion.",OnePlus 7T Pro
"OnePlus 7T pro is a great buy in 2020 for following reason:1. Snappy processor and the best non 5G chipset our there. Qualcomm increased prices for 5G chipsets and hence all the 5G ready smartphones are expensive. 5G won't be available in India before 2022/23, so go for the better value for money processor.2. Display is AMAZING. Quad HD and 90Hz display is an unbelievable combo. As many tech reviewers have mentioned, you got to experience it to believe it,it's really good.3. Charging is great at 30W and I personally don't like 65W one as the downside of very high charging are still not established. The combo of 90Hz and 30W charging is better to me than 120Hz and 65W( OnePlus 8T) as the long term battery is more secure and the battery won't dissipate as much at 90Hz.4. The feel of the phone is really good. It's such a shame, not to be able to use it without a cover, it just looks beautiful and weigh balance is done really well( at first I thought it's heavy, got used to it, in a few days)5. Stereo speakers are supposed to be good, I am not so much into binge watching, so can't comment on it.6. Alert slider is a great feature and fail to understand, why other brands haven't copied this7. OS is as clean and user friendly as it gets8. The vibration motor is really good and gives premium feelWhat could have been better1. Camera. This has a better on paper camera set-up than OnePlus 8T, as it carries Telephoto sensor. The main sensor is the same and the overall image quality is good. Should use Gcam for better results (I haven't tested as much, I would have liked to, coz of lockdown)2. 3.5MM JackWhere does this lag to OnePlus 8T1. Charging speed (I am ok with 30W and most people should be)2. 5G ready processor in OnePlus 8T3. Higher refresh rate (120Hz ve 90Hz). The difference between 60Hz and 90Hz is more, from usage point of view than, 90Hz and 120Hz4. Flat display vs Curved display. This is a personal choice. I have got used to Curved display and it's not an issue to me now.",OnePlus 7T Pro
"Best product of one plus so far!!! It has 90hz refresh rate but you can use 60hz until it's required to be speeded up. Battery is good and Warp charger is awesome, screen is completely mind blowing. Front and back cameras speaks alot as  trade Mark OnePlus shots but slow motion capture is bit disappointing. Rather than spending on iPhone 11pro Max you can have OnePlus 7t pro especially McLaren edition I just Love it to the core. So stylish and attractive model, a perfect premium phone. When it comes to value of money go for OnePlus 7t pro rather than iPhone. OnePlus 7t pro Worth it really.",OnePlus 7T Pro
"OnePlus 7T pro was one of the best flagship of 2019. I have been using it for 3 days now. Build quality is top notch although the phone is heavier than other offerings. Camera is flagship level but it is not the best. Facing issue with fast charging it is not as fast as advertised, replaced the product still the same issue. Barely getting 55% charge in 30 mins whereas in the product description it says it should reach upto 68%. That's way off.  Oxygen OS is super clean and fast as ever. Display is the best I have seen from OnePlus. Multi tasking is smooth and no issue playing high graphic games. All in all value for money at this price range. In my opinion better than OnePlus 8T",OnePlus 7T Pro
Received today.i am already a big fan of one plus.Now one plus 7t pro has become the star. You will fall in love with design n display. It's really very fast n smooth. Warp charge is functioning fast n battery is enough for a full day. Still more to use...,OnePlus 7T Pro
Very nice phone,OnePlus 7T Pro
"I ""side-graded"" to this phone from my Samsung Galaxy S10. I'm glad I did. Some reasons why you should choose this over any other 2020 flagship phone.Â° No cut-out full size display is a sight to behold. Whatever the cut out size maybe, it still takes me away from the full screen experience.Â° Lightning fast finger print scanner. It's as good as Touch ID in the latest iterationÂ° Very fast and importantly so smooth to use, due to the 90 HZ Refresh rate, giving an experience akin to iOSÂ° Battery life is amazing. I get a screen time of about 9 hours with mixed usage. I simply love it. My S10 used to give me 5 hours of max screen time. Only my iPhone 8 Plus had this kind of battery life.Â° Camera is on par with my Samsung S10, and by extension, it should be equal to the S20 also.Â° Network reception, Vibration strength, Speaker loudness are all great and no complaints.My final impression is this, If you want a no-nonsense flagship phone with a midrange price tag, go for this. Forget all the other like S20, Note 20, Google Pixel, Sony Xperia etc. They offer a different take on everything, not necessarily better mind you. So save your hard earned money and go for this.Dr Harsha",OnePlus 7T Pro
Nice,OnePlus 7T Pro
"Hey, I have never felt so unsatisfied with any of your handsets like the way I feel using your latest oneplus7t pro, I mean I have used OnePlus 3t, one plus5t , but have never experienced such problems during their usage, I mean I don't want to offend your innovation, but still, the edges are so tricky that whenever you have to close a window and the close buttons at the corner, you really have to try pressing it multiple times, this piece hangs a lot, like a lot, I really think this device is abnormal and incompatible for usage, it has already taken peace of my mind and I would really not suggest anyone around me to buy this phone, it's the price I paid for when I bought this handset, it has lot of problems, and the phone is making me incompetent at work can you believe this.",OnePlus 7T Pro
I purchased this although the one plus 8 is out as I prefer this to OnePlus 8 due it's clean bezel less designThe one plus 8 punchhole camera is downgrade to me over 7t pro in every aspect and I use the phone for video meeting . Looks like they went with punchhole camera to save manufacturing cost on OnePlus 8.Also hidden camera is always an added security featureThe resolution and pixel density is higher in 7t pro and it has a very good processor which will chew up anything you throw at it.5g looks like a gimmick as it will take years for the infrastructure to be set up,OnePlus 7T Pro
"Wiring this review after using this phone around 2 weeks, this is nice phone, with some lacking features.But main thing which is most dis-pointed about 7T series is heating issue, i bought 7T earlier but it had heating issue, so returned back, and later bought 7T pro Maclern edition, but this phone also has heating issue (not regularly like 7T) but it happen some times. So as per my usage i recommend iPhone rather than this phone.",OnePlus 7T Pro
"I have been using iPhone for the past 3 years. I am planning to upgrade to iPhone 12, but disappointed with the features that apple has brought this time. Mainly fed-up with the Lightning connector which won't charger fast, expected USB-C in iPhone 12, 20W charger(Which we have to buy separately) may charge it faster but have adverse effects on battery cycles. And Once the battery health goes less than 85%,it's as good the battery is gone. iPhone got OLED after a lot of days, but no 90hz at least in Pro Model, to top of it, so many reviews have shown that battery life is not going to be great in iPhone 12 & 12Pro,thanks to reduced battery capacity, besides 5nm tech.So i have started looking at alternatives in android and found Oneplus 7t Pro is very good. Especially the screen.!! Oh Boy.!! What a screen.!! trust me it can even beat out the iPhone 12 pro max display, in fact it's PPI is greater than iPhone 12 pro max. The Main USP of OP7Tpro is screen. Next one is speed, very fast android phone i have seen till date, due to 90hz and QHD+, it feels much faster than competitors. With SD855+ it doesn't compromise anywhere from gaming to multi tasking.Apple mobiles are known for software updates of minimum of 4-5 years, i am glad to see Oneplus is providing 3 years of android updates till now(Based on it's older mobile updates), which is very good at this price range. Rather than going to OP8 or OP8 pro, this 7tPro last year flagship is much better and free from display issues.Compared to IOS, android security is weak i feel, where as IOS security features are top notch, no others can beat it. So hopefully, oneplus strengthen their security features also.Due to marvellous display, one trade-off is battery will drain faster, when in 90hz and QHD+. But again it's compensated by the Warp charger 30T, from 25-100%, it took 1 hour for me, so because of display if you buy, there is no point in operating mobile at 60hz. Another let down is camera, may not be the best and i think so no point in comparison with iPhone, but having said that camera is above average and good to see oneplus is trying to improve camera with software updates. But oneplus have to seriously  focus on this area a lot.Finally, about seller, Darshitha Electronics. I was skeptical to buy expensive mobiles on amazon, due to the reviews i have seen on iPhone 11 in amazon. But i am happy that seller has sent the original mobile to me and it's well packed without any problem. Only down point is on the box, date of manufacturing is showing is October 2019, may be they would have sent latest manufactured device.",OnePlus 7T Pro
"First of all I would like to tell you that I ordered One plus 8 Pro but due to display issues I had to return it back. I ordered this 7TPro when I was about to purchase 7Pro but thanks to Amazon due to 3000 cash back and offers applied I got this phone for 42,600/- . This was surely a pretty good deal as I got almost latest device with few compromises.Coming to phone1. Camera : You will not be pleased but I bet you will also not be disappointed. It's a good camera with many features up it's sleeve.2. Battery : Yes battery is a let down but for a decent user at least me I charge it to 80 percent only and get a whole days life and need to charge it again in the evening, ate evening3. Display : That's a butter smooth experience especially with 90Hz and QHD+ you really will love it and obviously will never want to go back to 60Hz. One plus 8 Pro had 120 Hz that was also something I loved.4. OS : Oxygen OS is very light and user friendly. You can use gestures to stop music many other features without unlocking it. Other features include nice shortcuts and customisations according to taste. HORIZON LIGHT seriously wow.5. Sound : Sound quality is also decent and may be better than most of Oppo ViVo phones but not at par with iPhone.6. Charger : Nice charging speed though I am not sure it compromises on battery life. I charge it to 80% only.7. Bluetooth sound I have Noise shots X5 Pro and Amazon Prime Music . The aptxHD sound is seriously mind blowing .No heating or display issues was faces by me.Some shortcomings1. Battery and camera are two fields where OnePlus can really look back for improvement.2. I was shown a different date in OnePlus care app but talking to service center and Amazon executive I was assured that even though the device date was inadvertently shown of Jan 2020 I will be given service based on July 2020 purchase date",OnePlus 7T Pro
It is one of the very good phones available in the market.Screen : it has a curved full screen without a notch. The screen looks very impressive. The brightness and sharpness of the screen is nice and displays colors very accurately. It is a QHD screen with 90Hz display rate.Fingerprint Sensor : The fingerprint sensor is under the display and does a decent job. Though I found it to be a bit slow than the physical fingerprint sensor as on Oneplus 5.Battery : the battery is good enough to last a full day with decent load. It is fast charging so gets charged to give couple of hours charge within few minutes.Camera: The front has a pop-up camera and back has 3 cameras. The front pop-up camera closes is a free fall is detected. Good Job oneplus!. I will not get into the technical megapixels of it as it is widely known.The front camera does a good job for selfies and video calls.The back camera output images were real disappointment! The photos missed sharpness throughout. Got blurry on very little zoom-in. Tried all possible settings with the phone/app but the back camera kept disappointing. Older oneplus phones have a lot better back camera. Even the cheaper Samsung has better camera quality.Software : The oxygen OS does a very good job. It provides a lot of customization and also keeps up the support for a long time.Overall : Disappointed with the product as a whole for the price I paid. Not worth it!,OnePlus 7T Pro

"It's a good phoneIt has a good display camera etcBut the unboxing wasn't that great-the screen protector was dusty and had many indentations ( the display was fine )-a phone at this price range should include a headphone or atleast an adaptor-its kind of the same as the old one so at this price u could get the old one with 12gb ram-at the end of the day it's a good phone, with good cameras, an excellent display, fast charge and charger (included), latest processor-the wide angle camera has a pink tint on it",OnePlus 7T Pro

"Guys..It's an awesome phone when you look at it alone.It feels better in few or many factors when compared to K20 PRO, 7 PRO side by side.I have a 6gb k20 Pro for my wife.Here's what I observed.Pros#Beautiful 90hz no notch display. Once you go 90, you'll never go back to 60Hz.Stereo speakers855+, 8gb ram with Oxygen is the one of the fastest and finest Android out there.Curved edge is love. Though it's subjective.Quick charge. If you come from Apple background like me. You'd find t even the iPad charger useless. Honestly this was something I did not know I was missing. lolMoving parts on your phone - the motor camera. It's a bad thing to have a moving part yet it's been tested and said that it stays in tact upto 5 years even with 150 opens a day. So you'd not keep the phone for 5 years. Do you? If you're not a frequent selfie guy then this is it. Pro models are for you.And there are other 100 Android features that I can list but not required here.Cons#Heavy. If you keep using this phone for talking for more than 20 mins, your wrist tells you to cut down.No reachability for one hand access. I know big screen is a must in 2019 trend but without usability it's a waste.Curved edge - I know it's a con as well. When using one handed your palm touches screen edges before your finger reaches wherever you want to. And voilÃ , something that you never expected.Camera - Since I come from Apple and Samsung background I found the camera not so great. But for the price you pay should not complain mate. It's not as great as iPhone 11 series but it's there. As a normal guy who clicks pics while he's on trip, birthdays etc . It gets your job done.Gcam does fix the job so relax guys.Better than OP7 Pro?Meh, not really.Unless you're a guy who roots and explores too much. You won't even know the difference. Except the macro mode on camera which is useful but not useful. Get it?If you're just a typical guy who used for WhatsApp, Insta, calls and stuff then 7T would do it.If you don't want a notch like me 7 Pro will do.If you want latest hardware thinking future software support is great, snob value and don't mind spending extra money then 7T Pro it is.If you don't care what skin the Android has.. go for K20 Pro.",OnePlus 7T Pro
"Earlier i has Samsung A7(2018)- 128 GB model. I must say A7 is much better smartphone in terms of Camera image processing, PRACTICALITY, Durability etc.Pros of 1plus:1. Battery durability2. Back camera3. Processor speed4. Battery Charging5. Display Picture qualityCons:1. Pop up selfie camera:  both in terms of quality and practicality2. Default Video, mp3 media player and image display application3. Position of Volume buttons and Power button is bit awkwrd.Conclusion: My Samsung A7 smartphone is far better, given its price. I guess i was swayed by all that glistering around Oneplus mobile phones.I am looking to purchase smartphone for my dad in range of 20k-30k, will go for Samsung smartphone instead of upcoming Oneplus Nord definitely.PS. i had purchase the product before Indo-china border dispute.

"Had purchased this so expensive phone with high hopes,last night is suddenly stopped recognising the sim,have been contacting the OnePlus customer care since then....never ever expected this.Oneplus should seriously btake this concern and attend it immediately by changing the handset.And now the Alert Slider has also stopped working, it is stuck on vibration mode.even the support team is not able to help through phone.Never ever expected when we thought of buying such expensive phone on place if iphone.Now how can I get rid of it and get my valuable money can...

"Very happy with seller Darshita Electronics and even Amazon service. Me and my cousin ordered 2 pieces at a time both were fine n genuine. Delivery was fast, genuine authentic product. Fingerprint is not lightning fast as compare to 2020 smartphones tech. 4500MAH battery does the job for day extreme user consumptions require another charge in a day. Camera, display, Snapdragon chipset rest all all are fabulous. Only thing I rate seller 5 star is because of genuine product. One thing I am disappointed with seller is provided me 1 year old manufactured product my 1+ had date of October 2019 which created questions that why was the product unsold till now. Why not new manufactured product was delivered those were things to be taken care of by seller because after paying such huge you don't expect 1 year old box piece coz don't know how it was handled smooth or rough. But anyways seller does hardwork for his business only this reason I rate seller 5 star or else I would have rated 4 star. It is hard earned money and you should provide newest product to customer weather for discounted price in sale or normally. I have recently brought it in sale. Recommended can go for it no issues with product.",OnePlus 7T Pro
"It's a much hyped mobile. The finger scanner is very bad compared to OnePlus 3 (that i was using beforing buying 7T Pro).With new latest processor, i didn't find any difference between OnePlus 3 and 7T Pro. Not sure how others are comparing.Secondly, I feel No difference after upgrading, apart from design, look and cosmetics.Though i find camera is better.I really donot understand, why the battery is really bad, just lasting for a day.And another important observation as compared to OnePlus 3 is that 7T Pro stucks gives the feeling of less power sometimes.",OnePlus 7T Pro
"Dislikes:1. Poor selfie camera. I captured a few screens at the selfie was bad during night time and during day time over exposed.2. Poor battery life barely remains a day. If you are travelling ends up loosing power very very soon with very moderate usage. Make sure to find charging points in airports or else you will end up with ZERO battery. (I have done everything and only WhatsApp direct messages run in background, all apps and all whatsapp group notifications are stopped in background).3. Network issues which is most disappointing. I was missing calls and people were saying we tried but it was saying switched off.4. No official screen guard available in OnePlus stores. I got a case for Rs. 1490 which had 1+ branding and looked good but no screen guard for my curved phone.Likes:1. Good quality screen with 90 Hz display.2. Several additional features like ambient display and wake up by tap, navigational gestures in OnePlus which was missing in my Vivo Nex previous phone3.

"Too much hype but looks like it is designed by underperformer mi engineers and for that you pay 4 times the price of mi? What a joke.Let me get started.Screen is extremely curved. Give me a break. I have used samsung note 9 and then came back to blackberry ketone because width was same.This one looks like a pencil with all the curved space. Very hard to read anything or watch anything with distortion running at miles length.And not sure why design finger print sensor in screen. Long phones are top heavy so it is better to have sensor at back or side so that you have good grip trying to use finger print sensor. Samsung has gone terrible from note 9 onwards and one plus is bad from the start.And yes, don't expect to type for more than few minutes a day or welcome carpel tunnel because of top heavy design. Blackbery was far better. Unfortunately dropped too many times and now cannot get any blackberry phone. Note that I have used all iphones and samsung notes.I have given mi phones as present and was always amazed at their quality at such low price. Everybody was happy getting one.Nothing special in this phone except that it installs blaoware like Netflix that you cannot uninstall and it keeps on asking you to give all information.And finally the content transfer from old to new phone is pathetic. Samsung is way better that you can connect two phones and it will do complete transfer. This one will not do a good job and you need fair amount of androids to get things done. And bad luck of you don't have router.Sad.... I have to give this away and keep on using my blackbery keyone with tapes all around it.And there is nothing much sensor etc. Like at least samsung had barometer and heart rate sensors etc and screen was little more usable with less curvy design and also option to use back button etc that would be helpful for not so savvy user.This one will require engineering degree to use but you must first pay 4 times the price of mi phone to get same features at harder to use navigations.1 start and never 1.",OnePlus 7T Pro
"A review from a buyer switching from 1+ 5 to 7t pro.Physically phone looks good but is on the heavier side which first thing to notice the moment you hold it. It takes time to get use to it.Screen/ display is superb one of onePlus's best uptil now. For me Samsung has got one of best screens but this is one model which can compete on display. Plus you get full screen with 90hrz refresh rate which is simply awesome n you do feel difference.Pop up camera is good but over time i beleive it might be difficult to maintain as there is a possibility of dust particles entering it n you might end up cleaning lens before click.Cameras in general are pretty good and would have been best if Samsung S10 (also Apple) wouldn't be there. But at this price cameras are good.Warp charger in the box is amazing and charges superfast. But i woild like to mention about battery that it is ok not that it will last too long. I was expecting a good battery life which i got when there were no apps installed initially. Eventually when I loaded the phone fully I noticed the difference, earlier it was around 37% in 20 hour later 20%in 20 hours, considering heavy use, pretty decent still.Best part is OnePlus strives to improve so the above cons like battery life, camera I believe the company will keep providing updates to improve and they keep upgrading your OS quite fast, faster than other companies. A good quality product overall.",OnePlus 7T Pro
The phone looks gorgeous as per physical overview.The best display.Good camera quality.Excellent network reception.Clean user interface.Looks premium.Curved screen looks good and face no problem in handling.The only downside i noticed is the average battery life. It should have a 5000mah battery.And no always on display.,OnePlus 7T Pro
This product not in our expectations and same product available in The market,OnePlus 7T Pro
"Updated after 1 month of usage --->I have been using OnePlus 5 and then 6.I had high hopes with 7t pro. The cons that I see1. It's heavy, and very uncomfortable while carrying in pocket. Recently I have noticed that I am getting pain in my fingers because of holding phone. So its definitely not meant for high usage.2. Batttery life is unimpressive. Gets drained out by afternoon after full charge. I am gamer, so wished it had better battery life3. Constant problem with app switch being touched while trying to hit space bar. There is not enough gap. This was not a problem in oneplus 5.The app doesnot feel that smooth or super fast in loading. So even with 8gb ram and  much better processor; for naked eye there is not much improvement.Overall I dont think its a great buy; its definitely painful to move around with.",OnePlus 7T Pro
"Writing this product review after usage to two days. Following are my views on this phone1. Display - I personally purchased this phone due to the hype created by oneplus regarding the display of this phone. i.e QHD+, 90Hz etc. But in my personal usage of this device i didn't feel much difference in normal screen and this phone's screen. 60Hz display in FHD Resolution works same. I earlier had OP 5T  and except size  and curve of the display i felt nothing special in this phone's display.2. Battry - Battery back-up is good till now. it can last 12 to 14 hours of normal daily usage with some time of gaming like PUBG.  i am not a heavy user so can not tell the back-up of heavy usage. Charging speed is also good takes 1 hour 5 minutes from 0 to 100.3. Camera: Camera is decent can take good pictures in normal lighting, low light performance i have not checked yet, but as i saw lot of youtube reviews it will struggle in low light conditions. Selfie camera i felt improved from oneplus 5T.4. Perfomace: Performance wise this phone in a beast. can play PUBG in extreme frame rate in HDR. i heard that it will support 90fps , but till now i haven not got any update in my phone to play PUBG at 90 fps.5. Design: Design wise phone is really good. feels premium in hand.6. Finger Print reader is not fast enough and not so accurate. 2 out of 10 times it fails to read finger.",OnePlus 7T Pro
Not well perfomance,OnePlus 7T Pro
"Display: Beautiful QHD+ display.Sound: Dual stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos support.Camera: Superb. Low light photos, macros everything is nice. Macros are pretty amazing on this device.Battery: Drains a little fast I would say.",OnePlus 7T Pro
"Heating issue, the additional cash back above order 50000/- is a fake, pricing is too high as per performance. Finger print Senser isn't good. The manufacturer of this need to think over it. Other branded phones are providing much better quality at cheaper price than this.",OnePlus 7T Pro
third class camera. No quality atall. Extremely poor video rec. Even 10k handset gives better quality. No ois in video.  Video recording is as good as a 5k mobile cam.Macro mode of camera is good.  Network speex good.Dual speaker good but no way near samsung s10.,OnePlus 7T Pro
"Coming from my ageing S8 to this was a sea of a change in speed and responsiveness.The size of this beast is something I'm still getting used to though. The S8 was a great 1 handed phone. OnePlus has its share of issues in executing the big screenI have 2 gripes about the phone.1. S8's screen brightness and daylight performance is stupid crazy good compared to the OnePlus 7T Pro. I just couldn't believe it!!! I was super pissed at first but then decided to stick with O+7 as Samsung does not have Snapdragon options in this price range2. S8 had superior navigation gestures. I believe the Samsung's gestures would work WONDERS on the OnePlus size phone. (Swipe up left side for back, swipe up in Middle for home, swipe up from right for app switch). OnePlus's swipe up to hold for recent apps is reaaaalllly finicky and I hope they give more options with OS upgradesAlso 3. For 45k+ GIVE ME AN SD CARD SLOTThe 1 thing that this phone realllly got right was the stereo sound - absolutely crazy good!",OnePlus 7T Pro
OnePlus launched this model for people like me who wanted to buy OnePlus 7 pro but gave extra features to it,OnePlus 7T Pro
"This is going to be a long review so if you are looking for the summary - here it is - It's a beast phone! Buy it without thinking.For those who want the detailed review, please read below.So I was really confused between the OnePlus 7T and the OnePlus 7 Pro/7T Pro. I was earlier using a OnePlus 5 since 2017. I have watched every YouTube video possible and read every review there is for all these phones online. There are a few reasons why I chose the OP 7T Pro over the others.- Better overclocked Snapdragon 855 compared to 7 Pro.- Bigger battery than all.- Macro mode was added and its real fun to use it.- I' not a fan of the notched screen on the 7T. The pop up camera though mechanical gives you a fully immersive display without any ugly notches. Without any notch and a 90hz refresh rate, this makes the screen look and feel insane.- The upcoming rumours about the OP 8 Pro says that they are going to have a punch hole display. This would mean that the OP 7 Pro & 7T Pro would be the last phones to have the full screen display.I've seen a number of reviews on amazon that complain about a lot of things but here are my thoughts on the same:- Wireless Charging. Honestly Wireless Charging is much slower than traditional charging. Plus you can't use the phone while its on the wireless charger. Doesn't make sense to me.- IP Rating. OnePlus has mentioned that a getting an IP Rating on their phones would add to the cost, which will inturn be passed on to the consumer. I'm happy without it even though we all know that these phones do have some basic level of waterproofing. So its not the end of the world. I don't plan to go swimming with the phone.- No headphone jack. You can purchase a USB C to 3.5mm adapter from Amazon or the OnePlus website. Its for Rs. 200-300. Use it and plug any headphones or simply use the OnePlus Bullets Wireless or any other BT Headphone. Again not a con for me.- One issue I would like to point out is the Automatic brightness feature. I have no idea where the sensor is located but the screen auto dims suddenly and sometimes its really difficult to read the screen. I have to then manually increase the brightness. This might be fixed by a software update in the near future but its yet an issue as of now.I am not getting into the pros of this device cos every other reviewer has mentioned them in detail. Its the usual, best Operating System, blazing fast, crazy screen, super fast charging, dolby atmos sound, etc. Its all true and OP 7T Pro is certainly a winner!There are a few cons which I would like to mention that are different from other reviewers.- I do agree that the phone is a little on the heavier side and is also very slippery without a cover. I have bought the Carbon Fiber bumper case from the oneplus website.- I really do miss the notification LED from my OP5. However, I would like to mention something about a feature called the horizon light on the OP7 Pro & 7T Pro. Its a very cool feature that makes the curves of your screen light up when you get a notification. Just google how to turn this on. Ofcourse it flashes just once, unlike the permanent LED light on earlier OP phones but I am sure Oxygen OS will make some good use of this feature with some tweaks in the future.- I am definitely not a fan of the phone being available in just one colour! All my phones and iPhones in the past have been black or grey. The Haze Blue OP 7T Pro surely looks odd with a black bumper on it. I would have preferred a Silver like the 7T or a black like the OP 7 Pro. Bad decision OP!- Something not only restricted to OP phones but all phones in general that are launching. All videos such as Youtube, HotStar, Voot, Amazon Prime, etc. are available in a 16:9 aspect ratio. All phones now are sporting a 19.5:9 or 20:9 and even 21:9 aspect ratios. This is why there are black lines when you watch a full screen video. You lose corners if you fill the screen with the pinch to zoom option. Manufacturers need to understand this or either content creators need to change the aspect ratio.Most definitely non of the cons mean that you shouldn't buy the OP 7T Pro. These were just my points. This was my full review for the OP 7T Pro.",OnePlus 7T Pro
"With 2 days of use, good so far. Giving battery backup of 7hours on normal and constant usage. At the time of charging its getting bit hot but thats ok i guess. Looks stunning and camera and clarity both are good.",OnePlus 7T Pro
"Pros:90Hz screen and qhd+ display leads to great navigation experience.Charging is really fast 10 to 70+ percent in 30 minutes. Phone doesn't heat up during charging if you're not using phone while charging.Gaming performance is very smooth, COD mobile runs greatly on high settings.A lot of UI customisations available to suit individual needsPhoto and video quality is very good.Lots of storage space!!Speaker quality is awesome!Cons:During gaming, sometimes phone sides heat up to uncomfortable levels even with phone case.Battery is decent but not very long lasting, owing to high resolution and 90 hz display. Gaming drains battery even faster (obviously).For video recording, default available features are 1080p, 1080p 60 fps, 4k, 4k 60 fps. 60 fps modes record super smoothe video experience. However, All these videos modes take up quite a space even for short video and would make video sharing expensive. A lower video setting like 720p would have been great (this can be achieved through third party app)",OnePlus 7T Pro
Pro1. It's the Pro :D2. Mesmerizing screen3. Useful camera modes4. etc..Cons1. Had to disable face unlock cause the camera has to pop up every time to unlock and I was worried about the damages over time.2. No IR Blaster! Come on now have on of the costliest phone but I need to find my tv remote now :|3. Charger cable is very stiff4. No headphone jack! That is so iphone :(,OnePlus 7T Pro
When I ordered it first it was not working properly. Software problem . Hanging and lagging. Heating issue. So I replaced it and now I received a devective product. This device  couldn't start also . Am returning it. My earnest request to new buyers please don't buy this.,OnePlus 7T Pro
"Hell man! Im a oneplus fan till i buy this mobile,Camera of this phone is completely worse before i was using oneplus 6 ,op6 camera is much better when compared with op8.....and important point to note that this phone does not even compete with my moms phone samsung a50s which is 15k rs phone.Lastly if you dont trust reviews on this,Kindly reach me out atI will provide you the originals pictures,because i have wasted 40k ...not let you guys to wasteNote: i have seen all reviews in youtube,but all will say it is bit bad .....but it is completely bad.",OnePlus 8
"I changed OnePlus 8, 4 times! Due to something or the other defects (like headache giving screens, line marks at the back of the body, etc) as it's expensive!Phone boxes were puffed, torned, some displays were dull if noticed closely, more warm and yellowish. No control by OnePlus on this. People go nuts like ""wow what a display"" not realizing that they are being given inferior quality displays of Samsung.I hope I really hope people strive for perfection to really understand and get what they are paying for by controlling their excitements a bit and forward stronger feedbacks, as I believe I was listened and Amazon India did helped me too.My 5th device came altogether from a different location, excellent box, phone built and display feels more broader even with same dimensions, no two parallel lines design or defect at the back, it's clean and curvy like OnePlus 8 8gb variant (mine is the 6gb one). Screen display is still more warm which I didn't want but colors are very punchy and clearly shows the display is far better than previous returned devices.1st OnePlus 8 8gb - Had a very long permanent line mark at the back of the body if looked closely.2nd OnePlus 8 8gb - Display's blue light filter had issues I'm sure as it gave me headache in seconds, eye strain as well.3rd OnePlus 8 6gb - 2 parallel lines on edges of the back body if the device was tilted a little, was like a dent kind of design or defect (I believe though this one had the best display even than the 5th one that I'm keeping and more smoother 90 HZ).4th OnePlus 8 6gb - 2 parallel lines were again there so I thought it's normal and was okay with it, but display was yellowish and dull, playing pubg with graphics optimization made the game look more ugly in extreme hd settings (hdr sucks). Looking at Images on articles, etc were looking just good.5th OnePlus 8 6gb variant - As told above there are no 2 parallel lines, punchy colors, not dull and very good display, however still yellowish in large part of the screen and whitish around above and right & left edges of the screen in vivid mode (I did noticed in some displays it was not this warm). I also noticed vivid mode was nicer and whiter in previous devices than this one whether they were dull or not.I also know screen being yellowish a bit makes video viewing an amazing experience to make it more natural for skin color, etc. But should be less and corrected with all the flaws mentioned. However, I'm tierd and somewhat satisfied but will want OnePlus to correct if possible with software update without compromising any quality of the display.It's said that Apple never compromises on quality, they even delay their production if they find any imperfections (I don't like iOS or use Apple though).  OnePlus should do like this.Not happy at all with this kind of support. I noticed paying more (when I got the 8gb one) was really like getting better qalutiy made device (the first one, if the issue mentioned wasn't there). This shouldn't be the case as this leads to disappointment and all variants should be given the same attention/perfection with just internal hardware changes.OnePlus 8 will be my first and last device for a short period of time. Will look for a brand who cares. 3 out of 5.",OnePlus 8
"Great phone!Gaming performance is so great, device don't get heat up at all even at high settings!I played PUBG Mobile and details it provides were so exciting and make it feel real. Shadows of tree,stones, mud, etc. If you have small hands don't buy it for gaming, don't feel comfortable with small hands.Camera is good, can't say it is awesome!Battery life is great too, charge too fast!UI is as expected stock android, some pre-installed third party apps were also installed, you can uninstall all of them except Netflix.The back cover they provide is loose and cheap. Have to buy a new better one!Over all a great phone!Cheers! :)",OnePlus 8
On the first glance you will feel the premium quality of the Oneplus 8.I have mentioned few good and bad points for quick understanding for every buyer -Good -Very good build qualityVivid displayExcellent performance and softwareSolid battery lifeDecent camera performanceChic designConsistent performanceOxygen OS is blissClass-leading displayBad-No IP rating or wireless chargingLow-light video could be betterBasic cameras setup,OnePlus 8
"I have bought one plus 8 just 3 days back and now i am facing multiple issues like battery backup i am getting for just 3-4 hours of screen on time also facing issues with mobile hotspot as when i am connecting it with my laptop its getting reconnecting again and again however when i am conneting another device hotspot with the same network its working also its getting heat every time often i use lite application like facebook whtsapp no have apps or games are there i have tried to contact one plus support on call, whtsapp and chat but there is no response from there side",OnePlus 8
Camera quality is worst than OnePlus 6T,OnePlus 8

"Great phone, Amazon delivers it within 10 hours of ordering really happy there,Pros: Beast performanceGreat battery LifeBrilliant ScreenFluid 90hzAnd blazing fast oxygen os5gCons:Camera: have a 2megapixel camera for the sake of having 3 camera on the backRest of the camera are only averageHopefully upadates can fix that and given one plus history I think they will!Curved screen cause accidental touches and most covers can't cover phone fully in the front due to display Hence its prone to break more than regular flat screen phone like 7tHave a little bit of weight due to larger batteryPrincing is highly agressive but could have provided wireless charging and headphone jackIn the same price!Overall good phone if you want a future proof phone but this eyes closedBut if you are on a budget 7t can mostly get you there with better camera and almost as fast snapdragon 855plusChoose wisely",OnePlus 8
"Obviously, you might have done extensive research, watched many review videos before coming here to make your purchase decision. There is only one way you will be happy with this purchase and that is, if you are looking for a slim, elegant, powerful, light weight device offering a premium in-hand feel. Day to day, if this is what is most important to you, then this is the device to get.Camera is going to serve you well on many occasions (when the lighting is good). People might have told you that the camera system is mediocre. That is not entirely true. There have been few software updates and I can confidently say that yes, the camera is neither great nor is it bad. It delivers decent pictures (when the lighting is good) and if you are not a absolute camera geek, then this will meet and succeed all of your expectations. Incase you are a camera geek, then get the 8Pro and dont think about saving money.Conclusion: Feels expensive and has a nice balance in the hand (Its very light and is a joy to use). The glacial green in matte finish is makes the front of the device look expensive (with the dark edge-to-edge AMOLED panel). It performs like it should. It has an QC 865 after all! It will easily get you through more than a day with a full charge. Its a very low risk decision. Cant go wrong - Just buy the damn thing!",OnePlus 8
"I am writing this review after using this phone for 7 days. I believe real user reviews are more useful than Youtube tech reviews which are highly biased and not practical. I bought the 6 GB variant which is available at 42k. Don't go for 8 GB variant and spend 3k more of your valuable money. For normal users, 6 GB RAM is more than sufficient. 2 GB RAM doesn't make your phone fast, it's the processor that does that work. At 42k price, this is the best option available right now. I would rate it 4.5/5.1. Design: It is an amazing, premium looking phone. Glass back feels awesome. weight management and dimensions are also great. The curved display looks amazing.2. Display: Display is bright and visible in direct sunlight. At the lowest brightness level, I did not notice any flickering. In Natural mode, I noticed some yellowish color, it is some software issue or it is like that only. I changed to Advanced>AMOLED wide gamut, now it works perfectly. The curved display doesn't make any difference after 1 or 2 days and it comes with ""fragile tag"" so be prepared to take extra care of it. 90hz really makes the difference over 60hz. Once you use 90hz display, going back to 60Hz would feel like the phone is lagging.3. Performance: It is a snapdragon 865. Performance is buttery smooth.4. Software: This is my first oneplus phone. Coming from Motorola phone, my first priority was a stock android experience. OxygenOS is best android UI right, stock android experience with all required customization. Oneplus also provide timely and long term software updates to its phones which is the very good thing.5. Battery: I was using my phone at 90Hz all the time with all animations on. You would easily get whole day of battery life even if you are moderate to heavy user. For initial 1-2 charging cycles. I was getting around 6 hours of SOT which improved to 7-7.30 hr of SOT. Charging speed is also great, it would charge from 10 to 95% in around 50 mins.6. Call quality and in other day to day usage, I haven't find any issues yet. Speakers are also very loud and clear.7. Camera: here comes the one and an only area which I didn't like. Primary camera and ultrawide angle camera is good but not any improvement over 7T. and 2 MP macro camera is really pathetic and useless. I also facing some issue in front camera. Low light photos are blurry and during video calls, it zooms the face and produces blurry face. i hope Oneplus gives software updates and solves all camera problems. I found a solution for myself by downloading Gcam which is giving better results but still for 42k phone, camera is not that good.Conclusion: No phone is perfect. This has issues in camera department. but I believe other than that this phone is great, go for it. When You spend more than 35-40K, always go for brand value like Oneplus, Samsung, Apple.I hope you find this review useful. I Will update if I find any issue in the future.",OnePlus 8

No option to hide contacts without phone number.I can list 100s of missing options. But don't have patience.This is not the phone you will buy. They don't have basic functionalities. Better buy Mi or,OnePlus 8T
Product is good except camera. Oxygen Os is not upto the mark this time. Seems they haven't done proper testing on android 11.After spending 45k u will get a normal camera which was there in 7t and buggy OS.Every now and then you will get errors. Many useful functions which was there on older oneplus device is removed from this device. Stereo speaker is not upto the mark. Storage related issue is there due to which we cannot install certain apps even though the phone has 200 gb storage available.Hope they come out with updates to solve the problems.I would rate 3 star for this device atleast for now.,OnePlus 8T
This photo is clicked in nightscape mode... awesome phone .. camera quality little bit goes down after first update 11.01. Need improvement on os.expecting for better update.. fast charge really very useful 41 min 0-100%  .video stabilization is also nice,OnePlus 8T
"It is an absolute beast. The aquamarine green looks amazing in the real world. In the box, you'll receive the handset, the famous red cable, and a 65 watt power adapter along with Sim ejector tool, back cover, oneplus stickers and guides.While using the phone in real life, there will be 0 lag, excellent RAM management, and excellent battery life.The charging is blazing fast and that's what we expect from this 65 watt charger.I have charged the phone to 100% on Monday 2 PM and my battery is at 32% on Tuesday 10AM while writing this review. To tell you the truth, I have never experienced this kind of battery backup previously.I have played few games like FIFA and COD and they were smooth as butter.The phone produces excellent color and brightness. Tested the camera on some subjects, and I am very happy with the camera performance so far.Overall, this phone is a beast and it will definitely change your day to day experience. Gamers will definitely like this phone as there are no heating issues while playing and 120hz refresh rate makes everything very smooth.This is an early review and I think it's safe to say that this phone is not going to disappoint.This is the end. Good day everyone. Bye.",OnePlus 8T
Despite of being same camera as one plus 8 the picture quality is very poor of front camera. Battery back up is not good. Last only 7-8 hours. Now the touch is not working.,OnePlus 8T
"Charging speed is good, battery backup and camera is average, issue in dynamic range, no night mode in front camera,needs to improve in camera, software issue also there, gallery recalculats every time all photos of the albums, and takes some time to create photos after taking shotsBlue tint when taking photos at low battery, gallery loading (recalculating), heating up, camera is average, does not get a feeling of using a premium phone paying on higher side",OnePlus 8T
"Very poor battery back up, my earlier one plus 6 and 7 devices were lasts for whole day and night, I usually charge my phone in the morning, but this device in full charge with moderate use lasts only for 12 hours, I have charged the phone and it confirms now that it takes more than one hour to charge the device from 6% to 100%, screen quality and sound quality is average, it is highly by overpriced.",OnePlus 8T
"I was using Samsung before buying this phone. But when I heard the price, it felt like its offering flagship features for midrange value, so I bought it. Have to say this that its hardware and processor is best in class, but when it comes to UI it fails miserably. The features, ease of use and customisations that One UI provides are just on next level and can't be compared with the low level and totally buggy Oxygen OS. Its almost same like stock android with slight changes which are taken from One UI. Don't buy this if your old phone is Samsung, its just downgrade.After a month :Still the worst. And one more thing I observed is it is very bad handling OTG devices like HDD and all. And also it takes lot of time to load already existing files which is a huge problem when you are trying to move around the files.* Buggy OS* Not so good with handling files* Not at all good with external devices through OTG* No extra features as in One UIFinal review, don't buy it because it's cheap. It is actually cheapest peice of garbage.",OnePlus 8T
"I've been owning the OnePlus 5T for almost three years. I still remember getting it from first ever sale on the November of 2017. It was one of the best looking and feeling phone of its time. Even after three years of usage, the phone still feels new and fast. It was adequate for my daily usage and the processing power was more than what I needed. I never had the temptation to update my OnePlus 5T until the day I broke the glass on my 5Tð­ð. The phone fell straight on its face breaking the front glass of the display and the corner is chipped and has glass fragments in it. Though the touch and display has no problems, I often see shards of glass falling off from the phone which isn't safe for something which is in your pocket for most of the time. I decided it's time to change.I was initially looking to get an OnePlus 8 as I am a big fan of that curved display. The 8 was indeed a very good pick for my budget as it had everything that I needed and more. As I was reading through endless reviews of the 8, I came across a news about the rumours on the 8T. Since I had a spare phone on me, I decided to wait until the release of the 8T. On October 14, I saw the official unveil of the 8T and I initially thought the 8T wasn't a big upgrade to the 8. So I thought may be I should settle on the 8, but then I remembered what happened with my 5T. I also read that curved displays are more susceptible to damage even from small accidental drops. So I made up my mind and decided to go with the 8T.I ordered the phone through Amazon and it was delivered the very next day. The package was bigger than I expected. I didn't have much expectations during the unboxing. The aquamarine green color that I went with has a slight bluish tint to it. It isn't super reflective nor too matte. It has a very subtle gloss to it which doesn't attract too much fingerprints. Holding the phone on hand, I realised that it's a bit thicker and heavier than what I am used to (5T is the thinnest flagship made by OnePlus IMOð). But in-hand, it feels solid.Holding the power button, the phone came to life greeting me with the Hello screen and I started setting it up. As soon as I touched the screen, I felt that smooth 120 Hz display in action which makes the phone feel blazingly fast. This is a huge upgrade to me personally coming from 60 Hz. The Colors on the display pops and it is one of the best AMOLED panels out there. Personally, I had an issue with the 5T where the screen has a slightly warmer tint. It was showing while editing on Snapseed and Lightroom. But the 8T doesn't have any such issues. The display is spot on! I had an update waiting for me as soon as I finished the setup. It was for the camera, network and battery optimization. I updated the phone before starting to use it as anyone would like a bug free experience in a new device.The Oxygen OS 11 on top of Android 11 makes the user experience very pleasing and it is good for one handed usage for most of daily tasks. Scrolling on the 120 Hz is phenomenal and no words could describe it until you experience it in person. You would never have the heart to go back to 60 Hz. Oxygen OS 11 also offers a plethora of features such as Zen mode, Game Space, Insight Ambient display etc. They are very intuitive and enhances the user experience.Charging on the 65W Warp charger is a blissful experience even if you are coming from older OnePlus devices (Dash or Warp 30). It reaches 100% in 40 mins which is the time you'll spend on your morning routines. So you're good to go for the entire day if you just charge it in the morning. Battery life is also very good as I'm getting approximately 5 and a half hours of screen on time until the charge drops to 15%.Another major area of improvement is on the videography capabilities. Inclusion of portrait video mode, super stable mode, night mode video has made the video side of things very interesting. The edge detection on the portrait video works very well on slow moving and stationary subjects. 4k @ 60 and 1080p @ 240 has made videos so much usable as you could slow the videos on post and it could be stable than most. OIS also works very well. But, I feel the photography side of things could use a little tweaking on the image processing and overall white balance and contrast. The wide angle camera and the main sensor takes exceptional pictures in good lighting, but they struggle from over tinted greeny images on low light. It feels as if they are wearing night vision goggles. I hope this would be fixed on their next update. Inclusion of a macro lens is good, but for macro photography, I feel that you would need atleast a 12MP as the pictures look digitally over-sharpened on the 5MP unit.Over-all, it's a worthy buy for the money.",OnePlus 8T
"Received on 18th Oct 2020. 1+2, 1+3,1+5,1+6t n now 1+8t.

"It's not very often I leave a critical review for any product. But i was so excited when my new OnePlus Nord got delivered to me earlier today, ahead of time. While i am still exploring the phone, the one aspect that is a complete let down is the camera. The pics I clicked were grainy and so not cool. I must say oneplus, you guys really turned me off this time, like honestly. Most phones these days look and feel alike with the camera being one aspect that sets the winners apart from ordinary phones...i dont know what you guys did here. Not expected team OnePlus...this is just not you. My Poco F1 that i purchased 2 years back returned 10 times better pics. Since i cant return this item, I'm going to live with this for a while before i upgrade. I am sorry for the negative review.",OnePlus Nord
"Battery usage update: Drains faster than other one plus models...so for the ones travelling frequently, this might not be an ideal phone...fast charging is a relief for ones who have access to charging point....Morning to Night usage possible with moderate to slightly heavy usage....Bottomline: A good entry phone for those who have never experienced One Plus and the ones with budget constraints... For others, one plus 8T(lighter than pro model at 180 gms) would be ideal which should bring 120Hz refresh rate and maybe wireless charging too..And for those who can afford and dont mind a heavy phone(200+ gms), One plus 8 pro or 8T Pro would be ideal ones.(As per Amazon reviews some users are reporting display issues with 8 pro, so 8T Pro hopefully will be a better model.) I still use 7T pro which provides the best of One Plus experience...INITIAL IMPRESSIONS:No tint issue which has been widely reported.Smooth given 12gb RAM and 90Hz refresh rate.Lighter than Pro Model but still feels sturdy.Camera quality on par with top model one plus devices in case of outdoor pictures, Indoor/low light pictures are not that good...Not a fan of punch hole cameras..would have preferred full screen with pop up instead.Battery usage - needs to be tested but seems to be ok....",OnePlus Nord
"Pros:1) Clean and bloatfree OxygenOS, which runs as smooth as they come.2) AMOLED screen and 90Hz refresh rate really go along to make the display above average.3) Battery life is decent and will last a day on normal usage.4) Sound quality is good and modestly loud. (Drawback in Cons)5) The design actually fits the hand well as it is shorter than usual on breadth, and a bit more on length, all the more better viewing experience.6) Gaming performance is average. (Similar phones in this range have better gaming performances)7) The phone looks and feels premium while using.8) The alert slider makes it very convenient to switch between different modes.9) Face Unlock is as fast as other OnePlus phones. (Very very fast)Cons:1) The camera is not as good as it was expected. The macro lens is pretty useless, and the main camera lacks depth and the colors aren't as vibrant as OnePlus 8. A bit too much of beautification was there in selfie shots. 4K video recording @ 60fps is absent but 1080@60fps performance is quite good. (The camera is better than most phones out there but it isn't what we were promised)2) No headphone jack.3) The mono speaker is on the bottom right of the phone, which tends to get covered by your hand while using. Also, being on just one side of the phone, the audio isn't as well delivered as it is on a stereo speaker.4) No expandable memory slot.5) The plastic frame (doesn't look like plastic but it is) is a worrying thing and makes the phone *comparatively* less durable.6) Fingerprint scanner being under the screen isn't as quick as a traditional fingerprint scanner on the back.Recommendation: If you're looking for a phone which delivers high performance and smooth interface for your daily use, go for it.But if your prime purpose is gaming, there are better options available.Also, if you're expecting flagship camera performance, you might want to consider other phones. (Pixel 4a is about to release, that's far better probably)Update: Pixel 4a camera is surely much better that Nord's camera.",OnePlus Nord
"Yea..pre-ordered on 28 July, got it on 4 August. Package was nice without any damage. So here is my first impression:â¢ Display is so nice and 90 hz refresh rate feels so nice and smooth.â¢Camera is okay, but not upto the mark..macro lens and depth sensor at the back is just crap. Wide angle is okay, but images are too smooth without any crispness.â¢60 fps video recording at 4K is not there at rear cam, but is present for front cam. Don't know why they did thatðâ¢Premium user-experience.â¢face unlock and in-display fingerprint is good.â¢Phone lacks a true premium feel due to the plastic frame.â¢The signature slide button delivers the same good experience.Okay, so if you feel that you need a 5G chipset and be future-proof, definitely go for it. If you want a flagship perfomance, go for K20 pro or OnePlus 7T as this wont be a good choice for heavy users, but still a good experience in regards of games for a short-run(COD in high graphics and frame rate ran smooth without any sudden frame drops, because it got an overclocked GPU). StillI am satisfied with what I got hereâï¸*UPDATED*â¢Excellent charging speed(Thanks to Warp charge, 10 to 100 in less than an hour)â¢Battery backup is so good for daily users. Lasts almost a day.â¢No serious heating issues at all.â¢This is a mid-range phone(one of the best) and should not expect a monster perfomance from it.â¢One of the best choice as a daily-driver( If heavy perfomance is not your priority)",OnePlus Nord
"Heavily disappointed. So much of hype and the camera is not even upto the mark. Grainy pictures, looks like I have applied some kind of filter for my selfies. There is no way to undo it. The haptic feedback is good. However, there are several bugs on this phone. Hoping that they will get it fixed with an update! Also donât panic and nitpick with screen quality! Looks great to me!But donât  fall for the marketing gimmick. OnePlus promised something extraordinary and they have failed. Also, there were several troubles while registering my phone for the Red Cable Club. But several attempts and a complaint with the customer care, it was solved.",OnePlus Nord
"I bought this phone for augmented reality purpose. They even launched it with the caption ""World First AR launching"". But this Nord is not supporting Augmented reality. I am damn fooled by One plus. Totally disappointed for my long wait. 500 rupees is wasted for prelaunch.AR is must and should technology in 2020phones. Even 10K phones are giving better support.Why One plus released a skull without brain. So I return this worthless (for me). Waste of time.",OnePlus Nord
"Got it delivered yesterday , used for about 5-6 hours , to tell you this is my first mid ranger previously I was using s9 plus , before that s7 edge and iphones in stone age .My first one plus , a mid ranger , I assure you it's no less a flagship experience , forget bout negative reviews, no device is perfect .This one has looks , power and performance , don't know how useful is 5G modem but who cares that's the baggage we consider it as of nowCamera unit is also awesome perfoms well and remember it's a bloat free and advt free experience of OXYGEN OS .Cons , I am yet to discoverENJOY the NORD",OnePlus Nord
"Front camera is very bad , and low light photo is also bad. Need update in camera section. Worst camera. I was also excited about this product like everyone else because I was going with the one plus brand. But if u r investing 28k for a mobile then it should satisfy your basic average needs at least. The camera quality is below average. 1 rating giving only for this. Otherwise features are good.",OnePlus Nord
"An amazing phone!Got it delivered today and also received red cable membership which was unexpected.Formally had a one plus too and in comparison this one could've been a lot more better.The silicone case that came with it however, has the most horrible smell. Wash it before using it on your phone.Camera could've been a little better.The touch is not as smooth as the other one plus phones.Fast as hell.Colors are very vibrant.Does not have a notification LED. or a earphone jack.The grey is very attractive. Blue will be better.Will update on display issues (claims by many) after a month's time.",OnePlus Nord

   Stop cheating customers by arranging a tempered delivery with only an empty mobile box.

"Brilliant..I have uploaded some pics of selfie as well as Portrait shot of near by shot.What is loved is phone has very good sensor.It's my first phone after my job so it's really special for me.Fine Screen..Smooth touch..Camera is beast. Selfie is beast. Screen fingerprint is smooth. Can't fine a better phone. 256gb is never ending storage.Cons:Some apps lags like gaana FacebookTouch of 90hzs is not up to what other OnePlus device have.Phone heats up while gaming for more than 20 minutes.Portrait shot blurs some area.Google lens must take pictures, macro camera is uselessNew Hydrogen update is no where to be foundI took pics with my mom dad they loved it.",OnePlus Nord
ProSmooth OS - no lags at allAMOLED screen is good quality screenPrivacy - no useless apps like those found in chinese phonesAll other pros we would expect for these specs - no deviationsConNot a metal frameCPU is slower compared to current 865 flagships (this is expecetd)Note: I am releived the display is fine at low brightness - I read  some users sharing the green tint issue.  I did not face that yet.  Will update reviews in case of any issues.,OnePlus Nord
Display has green tint issue..display looks like a very cheap quality phone. Want to return the phone but amazon is not offering return on this phone.,OnePlus Nord
I used several phone except like this type of phone but this phone is very silky smoothy.90hz refresh rate speed is very good or smooth like an iPhone 11.the keypad touch was also very smooth.audio is mono speaker only but it is also good audiable(something missing in the speaker).the camera is fair.i think next update this camera quality also increase.this phone very very user-friendly .wrap charging is 30 minute time take 0 to 65% charge completed that was very excited.the  I appreciated OnePlus company because of less price for nord.,OnePlus Nord
don't go on brand name and look. very bad camera. i have vivo z1 pro and believe me it was clicking better picture than one plus nord and vivo is only for 18k. one plus is now conning the buyers and breaking their trust. this is really a overpriced and my first and last OnePlus product.,OnePlus Nord
"OnePlus Nord is a very competitive smartphone in this segment.Pros.Device is pretty impressive and looks premium ...1. screen looks great2. Camera works descently but after some struggle3. Warp charge4.12 gb ram is great and is very helpful during multitasking5.screen brightnessCons.1.even when Snapdragon is said to be best chip in this range ,it's the one with same performance as Snapdragon 845 wrapped up with new ai engine ,it still struggles to maintain smooth experience.2. Screen refresh rate of 90hz but due to less processing power it struggles to maintain the refresh rate.3. Mono speakerIt's not stereo speakers and you will miss this if you want more bass.4.ufs 2.1The storage speed and data transfer speed decrease is observed if you've used ufs 3.0All over this budget pack gets everything right but the hands on experience says even after having better cooling system in it..I have observed that my nord actually heats up very fast and it takes time to cool.If you're the one who is pretty intrested to use the phone continuously for several hours ,I would recommend you to reconsider this once again.This thing heats up pretty fast and it suffers to maintain the peak performance..OnePlus tried to bring a top tier performance to its midranger device and their performance is good but not great , OnePlus Nord does not make upto it's marketing hype. There are several potholes in this smooth experience and I expect it to be corrected during software updates and future nord segment.It's just a midranger phone in the end.For the best you can have I would suggest that you should see 8pro from OnePlusHope this helps ...thanks",OnePlus Nord
It's very poor phone company lair battery charger 30min 70% but it's not true,OnePlus Nord
"I was skeptical about changing from One plus 6t to Nord as 845 still have more processing power than 765 and 5G won't be available in India for next 2 years, Nord has gorilla glass 5, whereas OP6t had Gorilla glass 6.But in the end, I am happy I switched, phone seems snappier, better display and new design. Camera is good and it was right time for oneplus to jump in upper mid range market, since their main lineup is getting expensive with each generation.I don't do gaming, so 800 series was not necessary for me, Nord seemed like perfect substitute, since I am on oneplus since oneplus 1 days.",OnePlus Nord
"Being OnePlus user from start.. Expected lot from this mobile.. Nord in hand doesn't give that premium experience that u get from rest OnePlus mobiles...Build is very cheap...This mobile is like oppo, vivo...Should hav gone for OnePlus 8... Extremely dissatisfied",OnePlus Nord
"Dear camera enthusiasts,Don't go for OnePlus NORD. It is pretty much the opposite of the flagship camera that they had promised.1. Poor low light performance especially for front camera2. Lacks in sharp and crisp outputBetter go for OnePlus 7T",OnePlus Nord
